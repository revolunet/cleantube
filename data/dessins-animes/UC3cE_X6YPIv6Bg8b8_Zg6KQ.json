Instead, think of a couple of cartoonists, in this case, in Kansas City who get together and start to draw simple animations of fairy stories. The drawings are simple and fluid and really a lot of fun. These cartoons needed almost a thousand laboriously drawn pictures for each minute of film. The cartoonists were Ub Iderks and Walt Disney. Iwerks went on to form his own studio and make hundreds of cartoons. I don't know what happened to Disney. :-)",
