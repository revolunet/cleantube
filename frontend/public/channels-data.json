Instead, think of a couple of cartoonists, in this case, in Kansas City who get together and start to draw simple animations of fairy stories. The drawings are simple and fluid and really a lot of fun. These cartoons needed almost a thousand laboriously drawn pictures for each minute of film. The cartoonists were Ub Iderks and Walt Disney. Iwerks went on to form his own studio and make hundreds of cartoons. I don't know what happened to Disney. :-)",

Ils retracent ses origines aztèques en nous plongeant dans le quotidien de ses habitants avant la conquête espagnole, puis s’intéressent aux grands défis actuels de cette mégalopole.\n\nOù se situe précisément Mexico ? \nComment les Aztèques ont-ils construit cette cité et à quoi ressemblait-elle autrefois ? \nPourquoi et comment les conquistadors ont-ils pris Tenochtitlan, future Mexico ? \nDe quelle manière les Espagnols ont-ils asséché puis étendu la ville ? Comment la population y est-elle aujourd’hui répartie ? Et pourquoi les besoins en eau ont-ils fragilisé les sols, provoquant des affaissements de plus d’1,20 mètre, tout en accentuant la pollution de la ville ?\n\n« C’est pas sorcier », le magazine de la science et de la découverte présenté par Fred, Jamy et Sabine. A bord de leur camion laboratoire, les trois présentateurs nous emmènent vers des sites insolites et spectaculaires pour nous expliquer le monde qui nous entoure.\n\nRetrouvez les émissions sur YouTube https://www.youtube.com/user/cestpassorcierftv Suivez-nous sur Facebook https://www.facebook.com/cestpassorcier/",

Le royaume tente de se défaire de son image conservatrice en diversifiant son économie. Au coeur de ce projet : le plan \"Vision saoudienne 2030\" et ses chantiers pharaoniques comme celui de la ville futuriste Neom ou de la zone touristique d’Al-Ula.\r\n\r\nMais derrière les signes d'ouverture à la pop-culture et au tourisme, l’Arabie saoudite reste un régime autoritaire : atteintes aux droits humains, inégalités hommes-femmes, des centaines d’exécutions chaque année, muselage de toute opposition, et bien sûr l’assassinat du journaliste Jamal Kashoggi en 2017. Qu’importe : MBS rend son pays incontournable au Moyen-Orient et diversifie ses alliances, entretenant ses liens avec Washington, mais en choisissant Islamabad pour sa protection nucléaire.\r\n\r\nMagazine (France, 2025, 12mn)\n\n📱 Retrouvez-nous sur Instagram : https://www.instagram.com/dessousdescartes_arte/ \n\n📩 La newsletter du Dessous des Cartes 👉  https://www.arte.tv/fr/newsletter/ddc/\n\n📕 Commandez le nouvel atlas \"Le Dessous des Cartes - La puissance et la mer\", d'Émilie Aubry et Frank Tétart, aux éditions Tallandier et Arte Editions https://bit.ly/Atlas_DDC\n\n👉 Abonnez-vous à notre chaîne ! http://bit.ly/DDC_YouTube \n  \n💻 Retrouvez toutes les émissions d'Émilie Aubry en VOD : http://bit.ly/DDC_VOD. \n\n👉 L’intégrale des émissions de Jean-Christophe Victor (VOD et DVD) sur la boutique d’ARTE. http://bit.ly/DDC_Boutique",

La fin d'un demi-siècle de dictature, et un tournant géopolitique majeur pour le Moyen-Orient. Émilie Aubry s'entretient avec le journaliste et correspondant Arthur Sarradin pour comprendre les défis que doit surmonter cette nouvelle Syrie post-Assad.\r\n\r\nDepuis un an, la vie des Syriens s'est allégée du poids d’un régime policier qui eu recours à la détention arbitraire, à la torture et aux disparitions forcées pour étouffer la dissidence. Mais en 2025, peut-on parler d'une liberté retrouvée ?\nLe pays n’est plus le même : il est dirigé par Ahmed al-Charaa, un ancien djihadiste qui s’est rapproché des rebelles avant de chercher à stabiliser le pays. En octobre 2025, un nouveau Parlement a été élu, mais il a aussi été critiqué pour la faible représentation des femmes et des minorités. \nAlors de quelle transition parle-t-on ? Comment garantir l’unité du pays et éviter les vendetta ? Enfin, sur quelle économie fonder l’avenir de la Syrie, avec quels partenaires ? Et comment contenir le phénomène djihadistes qui persiste dans certaines régions et fragilise la stabilité du pays ? \nEntretien avec Arthur Sarradin, journaliste basé à Beyrouth, correspondant de Libération, Radio France, et du groupe TF1/LCI.\n\n📩 La newsletter du Dessous des Cartes 👉 https://www.arte.tv/fr/newsletter/ddc/ \n\n📕 Commandez le nouvel atlas \"Le Dessous des Cartes - La puissance et la mer\", d'Émilie Aubry et Frank Tétart, aux éditions Tallandier et Arte Editions https://bit.ly/Atlas_DDC\n\n👉 Abonnez-vous à notre chaîne ! http://bit.ly/DDC_YouTube \n\n👉 Retrouvez également Le Dessous des cartes sur Facebook.   / ledessousdes.  . \n\n💻 Retrouvez toutes les émissions d'Émilie Aubry en VOD : http://bit.ly/DDC_VOD. \n\n👉 L’intégrale des émissions de Jean-Christophe Victor (VOD et DVD) sur la boutique d’ARTE. http://bit.ly/DDC_Boutique",

Héloïse Fayet, responsable du programme dissuasion et prolifération au Centre des études de sécurité de l'Ifri, s'entretient avec Émilie Aubry pour répondre à cette question. \r\n\r\nC’est d’abord le président russe qui, ces dernières semaines, s’est félicité de l’essai réussi d’un tir de missile de croisière à propulsion nucléaire, le “Burevestnik”, censé pouvoir mettre en échec les systèmes d’interception, avant d’évoquer le développement d’un drone sous-marin propulsion nucléaire. \nDe son côté, le président états-unien a annoncé avoir ordonné au ministère de la Défense de « commencer à tester » des armes nucléaires issues de son arsenal stratégique de dissuasion nucléaire. \nMais de quoi parle-t-on précisément ? Quelles sont les puissances disposant de l'arme nucléaire ?

Entre accords commerciaux et partenariats diplomatiques, le lien entre l’île et le continent demeure.\r\n\r\nL’invasion de l’Ukraine par la Russie a eu l'effet d’un électrochoc, rappelant aux Britanniques leur destin lié à celui de l'Europe.

Et ces figurines, qui ne sont pas vraiment des jeux, ni vraiment des jouets, m’accompagnent au quotidien, alors que je suis un homme adulte ! Mais est-ce que ce phénomène est nouveau ? Est-ce que les empereurs romains jouaient aux billes dans leurs palais ? Est-ce que les Spartiates avaient une poupée dans leur paquetage, pour se rassurer avant la bataille ?

Mais elle est trop connue, ça fait 250 ans qu’elle est née cette année et ces romans ont été adaptés partout, c’est une superstar !” Il a fallu que j’accepte qu'apparemment c’était un trou dans ma culture, et on a donc décidé de lui consacrer un épisode, parce que vous êtes peut-être dans le même cas que moi ! À première vue, la vie de Jane Austen semble plutôt dénuée d’intérêt. Elle est loin de l’agitation et des grands événements de son temps, comme en fait la majorité d’entre nous aujourd’hui. Et c’est pareil pour ses romans et ses personnages. De son propre aveu, elle préfère parler de ce qu’elle connaît et côtoie. Bref, du quotidien. Et c’est justement ça qui est hyper intéressant avec son œuvre : car qui sait lire entre les lignes découvre alors toute la société de son époque…\n\n🖋 Écriture : Benjamin Brillaud et Hélène Pollet\n\n📷 Iconographie : Agathe Catelain\n\n🎞 Montage : V pour Valentin : https://www.youtube.com/Salveus\n\n🖼 Miniature : Boidin https://www.instagram.com/boidinch/\n\n————————————————————————————————————————————\n➤➤➤ Sources en fin de description \n————————————————————————————————————————————\n🔸Pour s’abonner et soutenir ma chaîne🔸\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP46_MXP_WG_auH88FnfS1A/join\n\n🔸Chaîne Nota Bonus🔸 https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrbbgYjbrXVYRM_iRGEDqFw\n————————————————————————————————————————————\n🔸Découvrez ma boutique en ligne🔸 \n➜ https://nota-bene.creator-spring.com/  \n————————————————————————————————————————————\n📚Vous pouvez acheter mes ouvrages en suivant ce lien 📚\n➜ https://www.notabenemovies.com/ouvrages/ \n————————————————————————————————————————————\n🔸Rejoignez-moi sur les réseaux !🔸\n➜ Twitch : https://www.twitch.tv/notabenemovies \n➜ Facebook : http://facebook.com/notabenemovies \n➜ Bluesky : https://bsky.app/profile/notabenemovies.bsky.social\n➜ Threads : https://www.threads.net/@notabenemovies\n➜ WhatsApp : https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029VaLz84n0QeanLM2D9l1d\n➜ Instagram : https://www.instagram.com/notabenemovies\n➜ TikTok : https://www.tiktok.com/@notabenemovies \n➜ Tipeee : https://www.tipeee.com/nota-bene\n➜ Site internet : https://www.notabenemovies.com/\n➜ Podcast : https://www.notabenemovies.com/podcasts/\n➜ Discord : https://discord.gg/6hztEKD27D\n————————————————————————————————————————————\n➤ Merci à notre partenaire NordVPN de soutenir la chaîne à l'année : https://nordvpn.com/notabenef\n————————————————————————————————————————————\n📷 Les images utilisées dans l'épisode : https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1C8LzcLklgq-t-WLJIMw_eaiAKAYqfJ9f/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=114961219766447019127&rtpof=true&sd=true\n————————————————————————————————————————————\n➤➤➤ Pour en savoir plus : \n————————————————————————————————————————————\n- Robert Morrison 2019 - The Regency years during which Jane Austen writes, Napoleon fights, Byron makes love and Britain becomes modern (W.W.

Enfin… un seul Corse ? Ou plutôt des centaines de milliers d’hommes ? Parce que oui, l’Empereur français n’était rien sans ses soldats. En fait, il n’aurait même pas été empereur, point barre, vu que c’est l’armée qui a permis ça. On parle quand même de milliers et de milliers de gens, venus de plein de pays différents, et qui se sont tous battus dans les armées françaises, marchant de long en large, et de l’Espagne jusqu’à Moscou.

En réalité, pas vraiment, puisque ces énormes structures n’apparaissent qu’au XIe siècle, c’est-à-dire au milieu de la période. Elles répondent alors à une réforme profonde de l’Église catholique : plantées au cœur des villes, les cathédrales dominent les toits et l’horizon, marquant le pouvoir du clergé sur la société féodale. Mais plus qu’un symbole politique, elles sont surtout une prouesse technique, un chef d'œuvre artistique et le miroir de la communauté locale !

On peut même dire : les pierres, avec le bâti, l’archéologie et les monuments… Mais il ne faut pas oublier la chair ! Eh oui : le tatouage, cet encre sous la peau représente et donc raconte plein de tranches de passé. Non mais : littéralement ! Combien de gens portent sur le cou ou le poignet des souvenirs, des dates de naissance, des noms de leurs enfants, des slogans et des titres de promos, de mouvements, de syndicats, d’association, voire carrément des logos d’entreprises ?

Ça a vraiment été l'une de mes portes d’entrée vers des univers steampunk absolument fous ! Et l’homme à l’origine de cette histoire, vous le connaissez, c’est un certain Jules Verne ! Un écrivain immensément connu, l’un des auteurs français les plus lus dans le monde, par tous les âges, et pourtant pas toujours apprécié à sa juste valeur. Sauf qu’on oublie souvent que pour faire  voyager des générations entières, il a finalement très peu quitté son bureau d’Amiens ! Eh oui, Verne a écrit une grande partie de son œuvre dans la Somme. Encore mieux : pour Amiens, il a été un citoyen très actif, et même hyperactif ! Alors, pourquoi Amiens ?

C’est le plus petit arbre du monde : 1 ou 2 cm, parfois 10, grand grand max 25 cm ! Et pourtant, c’est pas une herbe, mais bien un arbre comme son copain de 116 mètres de haut, le Séquoia géant, et notre cerveau arrive très bien à le ranger dans la catégorie des arbres ! C’est fou quand même non ?  Alors pourquoi je vous parle de ça ? Eh bien dites vous que c’est exactement la même chose pour l’art roman : au 19e siècle, tout à coup, on se rend compte qu’un certain type de bâtiments du Moyen Âge aurait eu des caractéristiques communes. On invente alors l’expression “art roman”, alors que ça réunit aussi bien des œuvres d’art que des toutes petites chapelles, des giga-cathédrales, et des bâtiments civils sans aucun usage religieux ! Alors est-ce que l’art roman, c’est une pure invention moderne ? Ou est-ce que ça existe vraiment ?

L’occasion de revenir sur son combat contre la peine de mort.\n\nOutre l’abolition de la peine de mort, Robert Badinter s’est consacré tout au long de sa vie à de nombreux sujets : histoire de l’émancipation des Juifs, étude sur l’histoire et la sociologie de la profession d’avocat sous le régime de Vichy jusqu’à aujourd’hui, et bien sur la dépénalisation de l’homosexualité, un projet législatif qu’il a porté et qui s’est concrétisé par le vote par l’Assemblée nationale de la loi du 4 aout 1982.\n\nMerci à  Rainer Maria Kiesow, vice-président de l’ @EHESSvideos  chargé de la Recherche et professeur de droit.",

        "description": "Je reviens aujourd'hui sur les origines des tensions entre Wallons et Flamands !\nD'ailleurs, si vous aussi vous ressentez une tension, essayez Holy pour vous détendre : https://fr.weareholy.com/NotaBene/Youtube\n\nSi vous avez compris comment fonctionne la Belgique… c’est qu’on vous l’a mal expliquée ! Enfin, c’est pas moi qui le dit : c’est une expression pour souligner que les deux grandes communautés du pays, les Flamands et les Wallons, vivent une relation très complexe ! L’entente entre Wallons et Flamands est parfois rude à maintenir, quand d’autre fois, elle ne menace tout simplement pas de s’écrouler… D’ailleurs l’idée de faire un épisode est venue lorsqu'en février 2025, Bart de Wever est devenu le nouveau premier ministre du pays en étant le premier indépendantiste flamand à diriger le gouvernement fédéral. Alors on va creuser le fond de tout ça, parce que c’est un truc passionnant… mais aussi vachement étonnant, je suis sûr qu’il y a 2-3 trucs qui vont vous surprendre !\n\n🖋 Écriture : Benjamin Brillaud, Jean de Boisséson, Simon Lechat\n\n➤ Découvrez la chaîne de Simon, Van de Belgique : https://www.youtube.com/@vandebelgique\n\n📷 Iconographie : Bastien Verdier\n\n🎞 Montage : Nese Kaplan\n\n🖼 Miniature : Boidin https://www.instagram.com/boidinch/\n\n————————————————————————————————————————————\n➤➤➤ Sources en fin de description \n————————————————————————————————————————————\n🔸Pour s’abonner et soutenir ma chaîne🔸\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP46_MXP_WG_auH88FnfS1A/join\n\n🔸Chaîne Nota Bonus🔸 https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrbbgYjbrXVYRM_iRGEDqFw\n————————————————————————————————————————————\n🔸Découvrez ma boutique en ligne🔸 \n➜ https://nota-bene.creator-spring.com/  \n————————————————————————————————————————————\n📚Vous pouvez acheter mes ouvrages en suivant ce lien 📚\n➜ https://www.notabenemovies.com/ouvrages/ \n————————————————————————————————————————————\n🔸Rejoignez-moi sur les réseaux !🔸\n➜ Twitch : https://www.twitch.tv/notabenemovies \n➜ Facebook : http://facebook.com/notabenemovies \n➜ Bluesky : https://bsky.app/profile/notabenemovies.bsky.social\n➜ Threads : https://www.threads.net/@notabenemovies\n➜ WhatsApp : https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029VaLz84n0QeanLM2D9l1d\n➜ Instagram : https://www.instagram.com/notabenemovies\n➜ TikTok : https://www.tiktok.com/@notabenemovies \n➜ Tipeee : https://www.tipeee.com/nota-bene\n➜ Site internet : https://www.notabenemovies.com/\n➜ Podcast : https://www.notabenemovies.com/podcasts/\n➜ Discord : https://discord.gg/6hztEKD27D\n————————————————————————————————————————————\n➤ Merci à notre partenaire NordVPN de soutenir la chaîne à l'année : https://nordvpn.com/notabenef\n————————————————————————————————————————————\n📷 Les images utilisées dans l'épisode : https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KKs5Me91fIR3Z-gBryf0kCFJ3dlIAdCr/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=114961219766447019127&rtpof=true&sd=true\n————————————————————————————————————————————\n➤➤➤ Pour en savoir plus :\n————————————————————————————————————————————\n- BEYEN M., DESTATTE P., Un autre pays (1970-2000) dans Nouvelle histoire de Belgique, Bruxelles, Le Cri édition, 2009. \n- BITSCH M.-T., Histoire de la Belgique, Paris, Hatier, 1992.  \n- DELWIT P., La vie politique en Belgique de 1830 à nos jours, Bruxelles, Éditions de l'Université de Bruxelles, 2009. \n- DENECKERE G., Les Turbulences de la Belle Époque (1878-1905) dans Nouvelle histoire de Belgique.

J’aime mes petits chaussons à la maison et mon cocon familial ! Pourtant, un des aspects qui me plaît le plus dans mon travail, c’est de voyager, de découvrir du patrimoine, de rencontrer des gens. Et à mon avis, je suis pas le seul à ressentir ça ! Ça peut même être un peu angoissant de partir trop loin pour certains. Mais on a de la chance avec la France, parce qu’il y a tellement à voir ! Et si on veut se rapprocher des autres cultures, il y a une astuce bien connue : les zones frontalières !  Nice et son parfum d’Italie, Lille pour son côté belge… On peut voir du pays, mais sans partir trop loin, et ce parfois même dans des lieux auxquels on ne penserait pas, comme le Cotentin ! Ici, on est libre de se connecter par les flots, et de recevoir un max d’influences culturelles depuis les quatre coins de l’Europe, et même au-delà !\n\n🖋 Écriture : Benjamin Brillaud, Jean de Boisséson, Eponine Le Galliot\n\n📷 Iconographie : Bastien Verdier\n\n🎞 Montage : Thomas Bernaudin\n\n🖼 Miniature : Boidin https://www.instagram.com/boidinch/\n\n🎥 Images complémentaires :\n➜ Thomas Zibrik : https://www.instagram.com/thomas_zibrik/\n➜ Pastille Prod : https://www.pastilleprod.com/\n➜ Visit Jersey : https://www.jersey.com/fr/\n\n————————————————————————————————————————————\n➤➤➤ Sources en fin de description \n————————————————————————————————————————————\n🔸Pour s’abonner et soutenir ma chaîne🔸\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP46_MXP_WG_auH88FnfS1A/join\n\n🔸Chaîne Nota Bonus🔸 https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrbbgYjbrXVYRM_iRGEDqFw\n————————————————————————————————————————————\n🔸Découvrez ma boutique en ligne🔸 \n➜ https://nota-bene.creator-spring.com/  \n————————————————————————————————————————————\n📚Vous pouvez acheter mes ouvrages en suivant ce lien 📚\n➜ https://www.notabenemovies.com/ouvrages/ \n————————————————————————————————————————————\n🔸Rejoignez-moi sur les réseaux !🔸\n➜ Twitch : https://www.twitch.tv/notabenemovies \n➜ Facebook : http://facebook.com/notabenemovies \n➜ Bluesky : https://bsky.app/profile/notabenemovies.bsky.social\n➜ Threads : https://www.threads.net/@notabenemovies\n➜ WhatsApp : https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029VaLz84n0QeanLM2D9l1d\n➜ Instagram : https://www.instagram.com/notabenemovies\n➜ TikTok : https://www.tiktok.com/@notabenemovies \n➜ Tipeee : https://www.tipeee.com/nota-bene\n➜ Site internet : https://www.notabenemovies.com/\n➜ Podcast : https://www.notabenemovies.com/podcasts/\n➜ Discord : https://discord.gg/6hztEKD27D\n————————————————————————————————————————————\n➤ Merci à notre partenaire NordVPN de soutenir la chaîne à l'année : https://nordvpn.com/notabenef\n————————————————————————————————————————————\n📷 Les images utilisées dans l'épisode : https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qS6oY8a5qbtpWdDhPHSDq216XYe0aPsv/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=114961219766447019127&rtpof=true&sd=true\n————————————————————————————————————————————\n➤➤➤ Pour en savoir plus :\n————————————————————————————————————————————\n- Baptiste Drouet. « Le grand dérangement ».

Enquête, analyse des preuves, confrontation des avis d'experts, vous allez voir comment le doute s'est installé, pourquoi certains pensent qu'une substitution d'identité a eu lieu, et quels arguments scientifiques s'opposent.\n-----\nMon livre sur le temps : https://amzn.eu/d/ieivgpG\nMon livre interactif (type \"livre dont vous êtes le héros\") : https://amzn.eu/d/7gtH53f\n-----\nMa chaîne secondaire : https://www.youtube.com/c/FabienOlicardLadeuxièmechaîne\nMa chaîne de jeux de plateau : https://www.youtube.com/@CKanKonJoue\n-----\nUNE PARTIE DES SOURCES disponibles sur Internet et ayant servi à écrire et illustrer cette vidéo.\nLe Journal du Dimanche\nhttps://www.lejdd.fr/Societe/jeanne-calment-etait-elle-vraiment-jeanne-calment-on-vous-raconte-la-polemique-3830387\nFrance Inter\nhttps://www.radiofrance.fr/franceinter/ce-ne-sont-pas-des-scientifiques-une-nouvelle-etude-invalide-la-theorie-du-complot-sur-jeanne-calment-3643329\nLe Point\nhttps://www.lepoint.fr/societe/pas-de-supercherie-sur-l-age-de-jeanne-calment-selon-une-etude-franco-suisse-16-09-2019-2335893_23.php\nMédecine/sciences\nhttps://www.medecinesciences.org/en/articles/medsci/full_html/2019/05/msc190028/msc190028.html\nBFMTV\nhttps://www.bfmtv.com/societe/jeanne-calment-est-bien-morte-a-122-ans-sans-supercherie-reaffirme-une-etude-franco-suisse_AV-201909160005.html\nTF1 Info\nhttps://www.tf1info.fr/societe/video-polemique-autour-de-l-age-de-jeanne-calment-une-etude-franco-suisse-invalide-la-theorie-russe-2132299.html\nArticle de Yuri Deigin sur Medium\nhttps://yurideigin.medium.com/jaccuse-why-122-year-longevity-record-may-be-fake-af87fc0c3133\nThe Guardian\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/nov/30/oldest-woman-in-the-world-magical-thinking\nThe New Yorker\nhttps://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/02/17/was-jeanne-calment-the-oldest-person-who-ever-lived-or-a-fraud\nSWI swissinfo.ch\nhttps://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/jeanne-calment_swiss-french-study-quashes-conspiracy-theories-about-longest-living-person/45230912\nCBS News\nhttps://www.cbsnews.com/news/worlds-longest-living-person-jeanne-calment-fraud-russian-researcher-guinness-record/\nABC News, via Reuters\nhttps://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-01-05/scientist-dismisses-claims-about-age-of-the-worlds-oldest-person/10686950\nVidéo France 24\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9zVv2laOsc\nLe Figaro, via AFP\nhttps://www.lefigaro.fr/flash-actu/2019/01/25/97001-20190125FILWWW00291-jeanne-calment-aucune-preuve-de-substitution-avec-sa-mere.php\nCommuniqué de presse de l’Université de Genève\nhttps://www.unige.ch/medias/en/2019/jeanne-calment-etait-bien-la-doyenne-de-lhumanite\nJeanne Calment – Wikipedia\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeanne_Calment\nThe Washington Post\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2019/01/12/how-madame-calment-worlds-oldest-person-became-subject-russian-conspiracy-theory/\nPLOS Biology – lettre ouverte de Nikolay Zak\nhttps://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article/comment?id=10.1371/annotation/b66ef9e7-01ec-4396-b8bb-fb5295c67e96\nLe Monde\nhttps://www.lemonde.fr/sciences/article/2019/09/16/jeanne-calment-l-hypothese-d-une-fraude-familiale-demontee_5510841_1650684.html\n-----\nMon site http://www.fabienolicard.fr\n*********************************************************************************\nMerci à toute la team de Sherlock's Mind\nContact (pro uniquement) fabien.olicard@sherlockm.com\n*********************************************************************************",

Pourtant, entre révélations étonnantes, découvertes polémiques, et batailles judiciaires, cette aventure incroyable est loin d'avoir livré tous ses secrets. Après le succès inattendu de mon premier docu sur la Chouette d’Or en 2021 (https://youtu.be/aRGeP_XMN7E?feature=shared), vous avez été nombreux à me demander la suite de l’histoire : que s’est-il réellement passé depuis ?

        "description": "Disponible jusqu'au 27/02/2026\nCoupé de la mondialisation, Cuba a dû repenser ses modes de production pour contourner l’embargo international. En quête d’inspiration pour un futur durable, Corentin de Chatelperron (\"Nomade des mers\") part à la découverte de ces innovations frugales. \r\n\r\nNotre incapacité à fabriquer nous-mêmes les composants d’un ordinateur ou à assembler les pièces d’une voiture électrique cimente notre dépendance à la chaîne de production. C’est le constat qu’a fait l'ingénieur breton Corentin de Chatelperron, qui parcourt le monde en quête de solutions low tech à la crise environnementale. Après avoir documenté son périple en voilier dans la série Nomade des mers, il met cette fois le cap sur Cuba. Soumis à l’embargo des États-Unis à la suite la révolution de 1959, puis privé de l’aide et des importations soviétiques après l’effondrement de l’URSS, le pays est isolé. Ses habitants, contraints de recourir à des solutions alternatives pour se déplacer, se soigner, se nourrir ou communiquer, ont mis en place tout un réseau d’entraide faisant circuler matériaux et savoir-faire. Corentin rencontre ainsi des mecaniqueros (mécaniciens locaux), des agriculteurs ou encore des ingénieurs redoublant d’ingéniosité pour “redonner vie aux machines”, passer à l’agroécologie et réduire leur consommation énergétique. Un ensemble d’innovations susceptible de nous entraîner vers un mode de vie plus sobre, plus sain et durable. \n\nUne ode à la débrouille \n\nUn potager urbain nourri de lombricompost où cohabitent fruits, légumes, tubercules et plantes aromatiques locales, des villages entiers alimentés en électricité par du biogaz et du biométhane, un réseau intranet reliant tout La Havane : c’est ainsi que les Cubains revisitent leur environnement pour subvenir à leurs besoins. Mettant en lumière l’importance des cercles familiaux et amicaux sur l’île, Corentin de Chatelperron célèbre la débrouille et le système D comme facteurs indispensables de progrès et d’indépendance face à la mondialisation.\r\n\r\nDocumentaire de Laurent Sardi (France, 2022, 52mn)\r\n#cuba #documentaire #arteévasion \n\r\n\r\nAbonnez-vous à la chaine Youtube d’ARTE Junior :  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXV7LUI7G1MaKRN18yQ5y7Q\n\nRetrouvez-nous sur les réseaux sociaux :\nSnapchat : ARTEjunior\nFacebook : http://www.facebook.com/InfoByARTE \nTwitter : http://www.twitter.com/ARTEinfo",

Sa physionomie est marquée autant par les épreuves du passé que par les fréquents cyclones. Mais une nouvelle génération de Mozambicains se bat pour faire revivre la mémoire du passé et compte bien donner un nouvel éclat à ce joyau de l’océan Indien.\r\n\r\nLongue d’à peine trois kilomètres, l’île de Mozambique se compose de deux parties. Considéré comme son centre, le quartier de Macuti est dominé par les maisons traditionnelles au toit de feuilles de palmier, où vivent les insulaires. L’autre partie est le quartier de Stone Town, où résidait jadis l’élite coloniale. Située dans le nord du pays, l’île de Mozambique occupe depuis le Xe siècle une position stratégique. D’abord au cœur des routes commerciales arabes, elle reliait Oman au continent africain. Puis, à partir du XVe siècle, les colons portugais l’ont transformée en important comptoir commercial sur la route des Indes. Les Makua constituent le groupe ethnique majoritaire. Au fil des siècles, leur culture s’est enrichie d’influences venues de la mer. C’est sur le marché de Macuti que le métissage est le plus frappant.\n\nDeux jeunes Mozambicains sont les porte-paroles d’une nouvelle génération. Avec une équipe de plongeurs, Samira Jamu explore les épaves au large de l’île, à la recherche de précieuses cargaisons. L’architecte Muhammad Cassimo se consacre à la rénovation d’édifices vétustes à Stone Town. Il travaille sur l’emblématique forteresse de San Sebastian, gravement endommagée à la suite des attaques de puissances européennes à l’époque coloniale. Ainsi que sur la petite chapelle de Nossa Senhora Baluarte. Terre des Makua depuis deux millénaires et colonie européenne à partir du XVe siècle, l’île de Mozambique connaît aujourd’hui un renouveau grâce à une nouvelle génération bien décidée à panser les blessures d’un passé tourmenté et à raviver la beauté de ce territoire méconnu d’Afrique australe.\r\n\r\nReportage (Allemagne, 2025, 33mn)\r\n\r\n#arteévasion #reportage #mozambique \n\r\nAbonnez-vous à la chaine Youtube d’ARTE Évasion :  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXV7LUI7G1MaKRN18yQ5y7Q\n\nSuivez-nous sur les réseaux !  \nFacebook : http://www.facebook.com/artetv  \nTwitter : http://www.twitter.com/artefr  \nInstagram : https://www.instagram.com/artefr",

Un art du cirque fascinant, tant pour ses adeptes que le public.\r\n\r\nTatiana-Mosio Bongonga a sept ans lorsqu’elle assiste à la traversée d’une funambule évoluant entre deux bâtiments, un coup de foudre à l’origine d’une véritable vocation.

Le film suit leurs préparatifs en amont d’un défi spectaculaire : enjamber le canal Saint-Denis en direction du Stade de France. L’exploit que Tatiana s’apprête à réaliser est à la fois un défi technique, artistique et humain. Autour d’elle, toute une équipe est mobilisée. À Saint-Denis, son complice et directeur technique Jan Naets est secondé par cinq cordistes. Trois jours durant, il supervise la mise en place d’une installation complexe et forme celles et ceux qui assureront depuis le sol la stabilité du fil.\nEntre grâce et prise de risque calculée, Tatiana attire tous les regards. Chaque représentation est une aventure aérienne et chorégraphique, accompagnée par des musiciens qui livrent en direct des airs et des rythmes qui font mouche.

Dans ce sport au caractère mystique, les marabouts jouent un rôle essentiel. Avant chaque duel, ces guides spirituels confèrent aux athlètes force et protection.\r\n\r\nLa lutte est née en Casamance et trouve ses racines dans les rites ancestraux sénégalais. À l’origine, les hommes tout comme les femmes s’affrontaient après les récoltes pour célébrer l’abondance. C’est dans cette région du sud du pays qu’a grandi Gorgui Etudiant, un lutteur à l’avenir prometteur. Alors que la plupart de ses adversaires sont issus de milieux modestes, le sportif, qui a grandi dans une famille aisée, fait figure d’exception. Ce n’est pas le cas de son ami et compagnon d’entraînement, Sokhor Clé. Pour lui qui travaille en tant que tailleur et chauffeur, l’enjeu est considérable : la récompense promise au vainqueur pourrait sortir sa famille de la pauvreté. Seulement, son dernier passage sur le ring s’est soldé par un échec et a fait baisser sa côte de popularité. Les occasions de combattre étant rares, chaque défaite compte double. Le prochain duel sera décisif : triomphe ou chute, gloire ou humiliation. Entraînements intensifs, rituels et prières suffiront-ils à infléchir son destin ?\r\n\r\nReportage (Allemagne, 2025, 33mn)\r\n\r\n#arteévasion #sénégal #sport \n\r\nAbonnez-vous à la chaine Youtube d’ARTE Évasion :  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXV7LUI7G1MaKRN18yQ5y7Q\n\nSuivez-nous sur les réseaux !  \nFacebook : http://www.facebook.com/artetv  \nTwitter : http://www.twitter.com/artefr  \nInstagram : https://www.instagram.com/artefr",

        "description": "Rediffusion disponible jusqu'au 06/03/2026. \n\r\nChaque jour, Janne Aikio parcourt de longues distances pour s’occuper de personnes âgées, en majorité des Samis. Une population dont le quotidien est rythmé par des activités ancestrales. Pour que, même à un âge avancé, les Samis puissent rester dans leur environnement familier, le gouvernement finlandais fait tout pour leur assurer un maintien à domicile le plus longtemps possible.\r\n\r\nSamin Laila a largement dépassé les 90 ans. Chaque jour, elle attend la visite de Janne et s’assure d’avoir un maximum de tâches à lui confier. Pour de nombreux retraités isolés, cette assistance est souvent vitale. Faire des choses ensemble au grand air et discuter : autant d’éléments rendus possibles grâce aux aides à domicile et qui participent du maintien en forme des aînés.\n\nÀ 85 ans, Niilo chasse toujours le lagopède. La perdrix des neiges est un animal farouche, mais le vieil homme a appris à la connaître dès sa plus tendre enfance. Aujourd’hui, il se sent plus en sécurité lorsque l’auxiliaire de vie Janne l’accompagne en motoneige dans le Fjäll, la partie la plus élevée des montagnes de Laponie. À Utsjoki, dans le nord de la Finlande, l’aide apportée au quotidien à la population autochtone s’inscrit dans la culture du respect dû aux anciens. En cours de formation pour devenir auxiliaire de vie, Maiju n’appartient pas au peuple Sami. Mais elle compte bien devenir la première femme de Laponie à exercer en milieu rural. \n\nPiipari est lui aussi en formation pour devenir auxiliaire de vie. Contrairement à Maiju, il ne peut compter sur un maître d’apprentissage. Qu’importe, voilà déjà plusieurs années qu’il veille sur ses voisins et leurs rennes. Dans cette région, le vieillissement de la population est particulièrement marqué. Si cette tendance se retrouve un peu partout en Europe, rares sont les pays où elle a déjà atteint un stade aussi critique.\r\n\r\nReportage (Allemagne, 2024, 32mn)\r\n\r\n#arteévasion #finlande #reportage \n\r\nAbonnez-vous à la chaine Youtube d’ARTE Évasion :  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXV7LUI7G1MaKRN18yQ5y7Q\n\nSuivez-nous sur les réseaux !  \nFacebook : http://www.facebook.com/artetv  \nTwitter : http://www.twitter.com/artefr  \nInstagram : https://www.instagram.com/artefr",

En deux volets, un voyage à la découverte de sa faune et de ses paysages. Premier épisode : l’hiver et le règne des grands prédateurs.\r\n\r\nSur les rives gelées de la rivière Madison, au cœur du parc américain de Yellowstone, un lynx se tient en embuscade prêt à bondir sur un canard imprudent. Mais en cette période glaciale, l’importante couche de neige a rapidement raison de l’agilité du félin. À Yellowstone, plus qu’ailleurs, l’hiver est la saison de tous les combats pour la faune sauvage. Pendant plus de la moitié de l’année, les températures polaires et un épais manteau blanc s’abattent sur l'immense territoire de près de 9 000 kilomètres carrés. Si la migration et l’hibernation offrent un peu de répit à certains animaux, comme le grizzli, d’autres, à l'instar des hermines, des wapitis ou des bisons, doivent esquiver les pièges mortels des congères, ruser pour se nourrir sous les étendues glacées et déjouer les assauts de prédateurs résolus à garder leur rang au sommet de la chaîne alimentaire. Des conditions extrêmes que le plus ancien parc naturel au monde, créé en 1872, doit à sa géographie physique unique. Adossé aux montagnes Rocheuses, dans le nord-ouest des États-Unis, Yellowstone enferme en son sein, à plus de 2 000 mètres d’altitude, l’un des plus vastes supervolcans de la planète. Ses éruptions, dont la dernière remonte à environ six cent mille ans, ont sculpté un saisissant paysage, parsemé de sources d’eau chaudes, de fumerolles et de mares boueuses. Terre de défis pour les scientifiques qui craignent un réveil du géant, Yellowstone demeure l’un des derniers écosystèmes intacts de l’hémisphère Nord grâce à la réintroduction de grands prédateurs historiques, notamment le loup au milieu des années 1990.\n\n\n\nOdyssée spectaculaire\n\nDes rituels de pêche des loutres de rivière au festin royal de loups affamés en passant par les étonnantes plongées de chasse du renard roux ou la frénésie alimentaire d’une mère grizzli et de ses petits, d'étonnants moments de vie animalière se dévoilent sous la caméra de Thomas Wilson. Pendant deux ans, le réalisateur s’est immiscé au plus près de la faune sauvage du parc de Yellowstone, saisie au quotidien dans sa lutte pour la survie et ses rapports de domination. Grâce à des moyens techniques sophistiqués (caméras thermiques, drones, vues accélérées…), le réalisateur livre aussi une sublime photographie d'un environnement d'une sidérante beauté.

        "title": "Une vie parmi les éléphants | ARTE Évasion",
        "description": "Disponible jusqu'au 25/02/2026. \n\r\nDepuis près de soixante ans, le zoologiste Iain Douglas-Hamilton étudie le comportement des éléphants d'Afrique avec passion. Portrait d'un scientifique devenu militant, incontournable acteur de la préservation de cette espèce menacée.\r\n\r\nIain Douglas-Hamilton n’a que 23 ans lorsqu’il part en Afrique étudier les éléphants sauvages. Il est alors un des premiers à s’intéresser à leur comportement dans leur milieu naturel lorsque, pour sa thèse, il choisit, en 1965, de s’installer dans le parc naturel de Manyara en Tanzanie. À une époque où les éléphants étaient le plus souvent scrutés à travers le viseur d'un fusil, sa démarche est pionnière. La population de l'espèce compte alors plusieurs millions d'individus et Iain se consacre à comprendre les déplacements et l'organisation sociale des hardes. Mais après des années d'observation et de vie harmonieuse, avec sa femme et ses filles qui grandissent entourées des animaux, Iain voit son rêve virer au cauchemar. Au début des années 1980, l'explosion du commerce de l'ivoire pousse certains États à organiser un massacre en règle, et le braconnage s'emballe. Dès lors, la mission du zoologiste se transforme : d'observateur scientifique, il devient militant actif dans la protection de l'espèce. Prenant tous les risques, il se retrouve en première ligne en Ouganda, s’implique pour empêcher les massacres et multiplie les interventions pour sensibiliser l’opinion et les politiques afin de mettre fin à ce commerce meurtrier. \n\n \n\nL'homme éléphant  \n\nIain Douglas-Hamilton a aujourd'hui passé les 80 ans, bon pied bon œil, malgré quelques frayeurs dues à sa fréquentation intime des géants de la savane et un grave accident causé par des piqûres d'abeilles. Il vit maintenant au Kenya, à Samburu, siège de Save the Elephants, l'ONG qu'il a créée en 1993. Les pachydermes sont aujourd'hui estimés à 415 000 en Afrique, mais sans lui, ils seraient bien moins nombreux. Pilote d'avion émérite, il poursuit son étude de leur population grâce à un système de colliers émetteurs qui aide son équipe à leur préserver un espace favorable. Riche d'archives personnelles en Super-8 et des témoignages de sa famille, qui a traversé les années de bonheur comme de lutte, ainsi que de l’éthologue Jane Goodall, spécialiste des chimpanzés qui partageait la même approche d’observation en milieu naturel, ce film retrace la vie hors norme d'un homme parmi les éléphants, et son engagement auprès d'une espèce dont la richesse comportementale reste toujours à explorer.\r\n\r\nDocumentaire de Nigel Pope (Royaume-Uni, 2024, 1h30mn)\r\n\r\n#arteévasion #éléphant #nature \n\r\nAbonnez-vous à la chaine Youtube d’ARTE Évasion :  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXV7LUI7G1MaKRN18yQ5y7Q\n\nSuivez-nous sur les réseaux !  \nFacebook : http://www.facebook.com/artetv  \nTwitter : http://www.twitter.com/artefr  \nInstagram : https://www.instagram.com/artefr",

Une pâtisserie qui roule : le Paris-Brest - Le goût du pays : Ania, une Parisienne en Australie.\r\n\r\nUne pâtisserie qui roule : le Paris-Brest\n\nGros chou circulaire gonflé d’un praliné à base d’amandes ou de noisettes, ce classique de la pâtisserie française n'est plus à présenter. Notre journaliste Alexis Sarini a arpenté les rues de Paris à vélo aux côtés du chef Benoît Castel, avant de déguster le Paris-Brest. Pierre Raffard, géographe de l’alimentation, nous explique les origines de cette douceur, des amandes et la raison du succès de la pâtisserie en France.\n\n\n\nLe goût du pays : Ania, une Parisienne en Australie\n\nDirection Sydney, où Ania, née à Paris, a posé ses valises il y a huit ans. Elle prépare une charlotte à ses invités. Elle parle de la différence de goût entre les gâteaux français et australiens, de la viande de kangourou et de la vie sociale organisée autour de la nourriture qui lui rappelle ses origines françaises.\n\n\n\nÀ vos marmites !\n\nPour les plus gourmands, on vous propose une recette de Paris-Brest, facile à reproduire chez soi. Enfilez votre plus beau tablier !\n\n \n\n__________________________\n\n \n\nLa recette du Paris-Brest\n\n \n\nIngrédients pour un gâteau pour 6 personnes : \n\n \n\n75 g de farine\n\n2 œufs entiers et 3 jaunes d’œufs\n\n190 g de beurre \n\n10 cl d'eau \n\n185 g de sucre \n\n1 pincée de sel \n\n25 cl de lait \n\n2 c. à s. de maïzena \n\n170 g d'amandes\n\n \n\nÉtapes de préparation : \n\n \n\nPâte à choux : \n\n \n\nFaites bouillir rapidement dans une casserole l'eau, le sucre et 40 gr de beurre en morceaux.\n\n \n\nÉteignez le feu et ajoutez d'un coup la farine et le sel en mélangeant rapidement avec une cuillère en bois. La pâte doit se décoller du fond de la casserole. \n\n \n\nAjoutez à la pâte, un à la fois, deux œufs battus, jusqu'à obtenir une préparation lisse et pas trop liquide. \n\n \n\nFormez un cercle de 15 cm de diamètre sur un papier sulfurisé et cuisez à 180°, 35 minutes environ sans jamais ouvrir le four. \n\n \n\nLaissez refroidir.\n\n \n\nLa crème pâtissière : \n\n \n\nFouettez les trois jaunes d’œufs et le sucre puis ajoutez la maïzena. \n\n \n\nFaites bouillir le lait et versez-le sur le mélange précédent en remuant vivement. \n\n \n\nRemettez sur feu doux en fouettant bien, jusqu'à la première ébullition.  \n\n \n\nÉteignez et laissez refroidir 10 minutes. Ajoutez alors 50 g de beurre en petits morceaux en fouettant. \n\n \n\nLaissez refroidir la crème au frigo.\n\n\n\nLe praliné : \n\n \n\nFaites caraméliser les amandes avec le sucre en remuant sans cesse. Le sucre va cristalliser puis refondre et caraméliser. \n\n \n\nAtteignez le brun clair et débarrassez en couche fine, rapidement sur une feuille de papier cuisson. Laissez durcir. \n\n \n\nCassez des morceaux de caramel refroidis et mettez-les dans un robot. Mixez longtemps jusqu'à obtenir une pâte presque liquide. \n\n \n\nLa crème Paris-Brest : \n\n \n\nFouettez les 100 g de beurre restant. Ajoutez-les au praliné et le tout à la crème pâtissière.\n\n \n\nFouettez 3 minutes à la main ou au robot. \n\n \n\nIncisez le cercle de pâte à choux avec un couteau et garnir généreusement de crème, avec une poche à douille étoile.\n\n \n\nRefermez avec le couvercle et servez aussitôt.\r\n\r\nMagazine (2024, 30mn)\r\n\r\n#arteévasion #cuisine #paris \n\r\nAbonnez-vous à la chaine Youtube d’ARTE Évasion :  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXV7LUI7G1MaKRN18yQ5y7Q\n\nSuivez-nous sur les réseaux !  \nFacebook : http://www.facebook.com/artetv  \nTwitter : http://www.twitter.com/artefr  \nInstagram : https://www.instagram.com/artefr",

        "description": "Disponible jusqu'au 24/03/2026. \n\r\nL’estran comme vous ne l’avez jamais vu ! Guerre, survie et ballet marin : dans une odyssée façon \"Microscomos\" aux somptueuses images, ce documentaire filme au plus près le huis clos aquatique de la marée basse et son bestiaire haut en couleur.  \r\n\r\nSur les rivages de Bretagne, le long de ses côtes de granit, se répète à chaque marée basse un huis clos aquatique. Sur l’estran mélancolique, quand la mer se retire, habitants réguliers et visiteurs piégés se côtoient dans des arènes éphémères miniatures. Tous doivent survivre pendant treize heures. Le temps du flux, de l’étale et du reflux, les règles du jeu marin s’inversent jusqu’au retour de l’océan : les prédateurs peuvent devenir des proies, révélant des vulnérabilités inattendues, des alliances étonnantes se forment et des intrus tentent de s’adapter à cette nouvelle loi du plus fort. Seigneur incontesté et terrassier hors pair, le homard trouve dans le congre un précieux garde du corps. Le poulpe caméléon, monstre prédateur aux neuf cerveaux, chasse avec agilité, tandis que le crabe parade en quête d’amour. Dans son bunker, la patelle s’arrime à son rocher et le petit requin lutte contre l’asphyxie. En maraude, le goéland, lui, guette du ciel les imprudents, alors qu’en charognards patentés les nasses réticulées jouent les éboueurs. Quant au bernard-l’hermite, figure drolatique à la recherche d’un logement vacant et sûr, il se faufile dans cette guerre impitoyable. \n\n \n\nCombats titanesques \n\nGrâce à des techniques de prise de vues innovantes, cette fresque haletante façon Microcosmos, dont la marée devient le métronome dramaturgique, plonge au cœur de l’estran et de ses combats titanesques pour la survie. Car chaque heure accentue la tension : la température monte, l’eau s’évapore, la salinité augmente et l’oxygène se raréfie, poussant ce petit monde du chacun pour soi à inventer des stratégies pour résister. La nuit, d’autres batailles font rage, comme dans cette séquence spectaculaire où une étoile de mer, échouant à détruire le bouclier d’une coquille Saint-Jacques, se venge sur une moule et sort son estomac pour l’avaler. Mais en révélant les prouesses de ce bestiaire haut en couleur, cette épopée fantastique offre aussi, en les observant, un reflet saisissant du réchauffement climatique.\r\n\r\nDocumentaire d'Alexis Barbier-Bouvet et Manuel Lefèvre (France, 2023, 1h30mn)\r\n\r\n#arteévasion #mer #animaux \n\r\nAbonnez-vous à la chaine Youtube d’ARTE Évasion :  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXV7LUI7G1MaKRN18yQ5y7Q\n\nSuivez-nous sur les réseaux !  \nFacebook : http://www.facebook.com/artetv  \nTwitter : http://www.twitter.com/artefr  \nInstagram : https://www.instagram.com/artefr",

Depuis des décennies, l'idée d'une source d'énergie illimitée, accessible à tous et gratuite alimente les espoirs et les fantasmes. Mais qu'en est-il vraiment ? Bien que la science et la technologie actuelles nous indiquent que la notion d'énergie libre, telle qu'elle est souvent imaginée, relève de l'impossible, l'intérêt et la croyance envers ce concept demeurent tenaces. Pourquoi une telle fascination persiste-t-elle ? Quelles sont les origines de ces théories, et sur quelles méprises ou malentendus se fondent-elles ?\n\nAu cours de ce live, Monsieur Bidouille nous apportera son éclairage unique, mêlant expertise technique et approche critique, pour démêler le vrai du faux.\n L’émission est animée par RealMyop directement depuis le bâtiment de recherches d'Orange Atalante à Cesson-Sévigné.\n\n▶️Retrouvez la chaine de notre intervenant :\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@monsieurbidouille\n\n🥂Pour venir discuter du sujet de ce soir ou de toute autre sujet scientifique ou culturel, rejoignez le Discord : https://discord.gg/2uQT2r9\n\n\n🎵 Merci à La Grande Table pour ses musiques.

Visitez notre boutique ! https://boutique.nesprod.net/\n\nDans le passé, certains sujets, comme les jeux vidéo, étaient bannis des écrans de télévision par les grandes chaînes. Pourtant, aujourd'hui, les gamers ont trouvé refuge sur des plateformes comme Youtube et Twitch.

Cet endroit est souvent malmené par les tempêtes et la météo change très rapidement ! Nous en profitons pour explique aux enfants le principe de l’érosion.\n\nJuste en face de la petite ville de Percé, il y a l’île Bonaventure:  fous de bassan et phoques peuvent y être observés lors de petites randonnées à la journée. Nous ne pourrons malheureusement pas y aller à cause de la météo trop mauvaise, les bateaux ne partiront pas !\n\nC’est un mal pour un bien puisque nous découvrons « Le Magasin Général de 1928\" situé à l’Anse à Beau-fils, juste à côté de la ville de Percé. Cette visite nous plonge dans l’histoire de la Gaspésie et le mode de vie des pêcheurs des années 30.

Je dis que le terme “exposition aux écrans” est trompeur, car un écran, en soi, est un objet inerte et sans danger - même allumé. Ce ne sont pas les écrans qui posent problème, mais l’usage qu’on en fait et les contenus qu’ils diffusent.\nAutrement dit, la question relève de l’éducation aux médias, pas de la diabolisation d’un outil neutre.\n\nMa vidéo ne nie absolument pas les effets négatifs d’une consommation excessive de contenus médiocres - au contraire, elle les dénonce. Mais regrouper ces dérives sous l’étiquette vague de “l’abus d’écran” est une erreur de raisonnement : un raccourci, une heuristique, qui alimente une panique morale autour des écrans. Cette peur irrationnelle conduit parfois à des interdictions extrêmes ou à un jugement moral entre parents, fondé sur une méprise plutôt que sur la compréhension réelle des enjeux.\n\nCette vidéo parle de publications scientifiques, se permettant de critiquer les recommandations souvent caricaturales - à des fins d'efficacité populaire (discutables selon moi dans la mesure ou elles ignorent la diabolisation irrationnelle de l'objet et manquent une occasion d'utiliser le terme qui me parait le plus important : ÉDUCATION AUX MEDIAS) - des diverses agences nationales en charge de la santé publique. \n\nS O U R C E S\n\nhttps://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/jorf/id/JORFTEXT000019342258 \nhttps://afpa.org/content/uploads/2017/06/3-6-9-12_tisseron.pdf \nhttps://www.academie-sciences.fr/pdf/rapport/avis0113.pdf \nhttps://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9095723/ \nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-11341-2 \nhttps://www.hcsp.fr/Explore.cgi/Telecharger?NomFichier=hcspa20191212_effedelexpodesenfaetdesjeunauxcr.pdf\nhttps://www.inrs.fr/risques/rayonnements-optiques/eclairage-led.html\nhttps://www.vie-publique.fr/files/rapport/pdf/273315.pdf",

Il est aussi possible qu’une “souche de base” non modifiée fuite, surtout si elle n'est pas stockée en P4 (et même en P4, l’erreur est humaine, ça peut arriver). J’aurais trouvé intéressant d’apporter les “arguments” géo-politiques de cette affaire, plus complexes certes, mais ne pas oublier que dans de rares cas la science, ou en tout cas la communication, peut être influencée voire “étouffée” (cf. affaire Jiankui He dont on n'entend plus parler du tout, déjà que ça n’avait pas été super couvert). Je ne priorise aucune hypothèse, en tant que scientifique j’aurais même tendance à suivre ce que les chercheurs ayant fait le taf proposent, à savoir plutôt une zoonose. Tout ça pour dire que quelques minutes pour parler des inspections programmées par l’OMS qui ont été refusées (finalement acceptées mais les inspecteurs étaient accompagnés 24/24 par les Chinois et n’ont eu accès qu’à une petite partie du site et des données, évidemment pas ce qu’ils avaient demandé de voir), les bases de données de séquençages de virus qui ont malheureusement disparu suite à un “incident technique” et autres trucs un peu louches. Pour finir, l’affaire se passant en Chine, on ne peut pas dénier le fait que les infos transmises ou disponibles ont pu être délibérément falsifiées et que certains éléments aient pu être cachés.\n\nCorrection:\n11:32 petite erreur dans le le texte, le wifi, les ondes GSM et ondes radios au sens large sont non-ionisants. Les rayons ionisant sont les UV, les rayons X et rayons gamma.\n\n les ondes radios dont la 5G fait partie, sont des rayonnement EM NON ionisants, les niveau d'énergie des ondes EM ionisantes sont égaux ou supérieur aux UV (la limites se situe dans cette bande de fréquences). Pour rappel les UV ont un niveau d'énergie supérieur à la lumière visible qui elle-même est plus énergétique que les ondes radio (y compris les bande 6Ghz et 32GHz de la michante 5G qui tue... pas - et avant qu'il y ait un commentaire, non actuellement il n'y a pas d'exploitation de fréquences supérieure à 6GHz pour la 5G mais la norme prévoit potentiellement des bandes de fréquences jusque vers les 32 GHz ou qqc de cet ordre)\n\nS O U R C E S\n\nhttps://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/4fdc0d03d3a34aa485de1fb0d2650ee0\nhttps://www.notre-environnement.gouv.fr/actualites/essentiels/article/zoonoses-quels-liens-entre-atteintes-a-la-biodiversite-et-pandemies\nhttps://perma.cc/SW6Y-USX3\nhttps://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/Declassified-Assessment-on-COVID-19-Origins.pdf\nhttps://www.dw.com/en/covid-19-why-were-looking-for-the-pandemics-origin/a-68513146\nhttps://www.factcheck.org/2023/03/scicheck-still-no-determination-on-covid-19-origin/\nhttps://www.pasteur.fr/fr/journal-recherche/actualites/origine-du-sars-cov-2-recherches-se-poursuivent\nhttps://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/4fdc0d03d3a34aa485de1fb0d2650ee0\nhttps://www.google.com/maps/@30.6184267,114.2630364,461m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m2!11m1!3e4?authuser=0&entry=ttu\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01529-3\nhttps://www.genengnews.com/topics/coronavirus/coronavirus-evolved-naturally-and-is-not-a-laboratory-construct-genetic-study-shows/\nhttps://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/psych-unseen/202004/covid-19-conspiracy-theories-was-sars-cov-2-made-in-a-lab\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/nm.3985\nhttps://ca.news.yahoo.com/explainer-chinas-mojiang-mine-role-024847476.html\nhttps://www.factcheck.org/2021/06/scicheck-the-facts-and-gaps-on-the-origin-of-the-coronavirus/",

En fait c'est la perte de liberté de s'abstenir d'alcool, quelle que soit la fréquence à laquelle tu \"cèdes\". Quelqu'un qui est incapable de renoncer à son verre hebdomadaire a sans doute une dépendance. Après il y a plein d'autres éléments. Ça peut être le fait de continuer à boire quand il y a des répercussions négatives. Je ne sais pas non plus d'où viennent les termes \"chronique\" et \"cyclique\", ce sont des formes de consommation mais qui ne sous-entendent pas nécessairement une dépendance.\nJe te trouve aussi très catégorique sur qui \"n'est pas alcoolique\". La dépendance, ça va et ça vient, ça évolue par phases, et dire aux gens que s'ils sont capables de ne pas rechercher sciemment l'ivresse implique une absence d'addiction, ça me semble dangereux. Beaucoup de personnes utilisent l'alcool comme anxiolytique ou anesthésiant affectif.\n\nS O U R C E S\n\nQuelle époque\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdnryAfhPA\n\nGontran H / La méthode simple pour en finir avec la cigarette\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz2BtB5hWcY\nAchetez ce livre, offrez-vous une chance de plus:\nhttps://www.amazon.fr/s?k=allen+carr+en+finir+avec+la+cigarette&language=fr_FR&linkCode=sl2&linkId=632fadf68cf4542a5f8f1278475977b3&sprefix=allen+carr%2Caps%2C190&tag=gontranh-21&ref=as_li_ss_tl\n\nComme j'ai dit dans la vidéo, elle n'est ni exhaustive ni précise.

        "description": "Documentaire disponible en rediffusion jusqu'au 08/04/2026\n\r\nCréateur d'une absolue liberté, David Lynch a construit son oeuvre comme une énigme à déchiffrer entre rêve et réalité. Réalisateur culte dès ses premiers films (\"Eraserhead\", \"Elephant Man\"), Lynch bouleverse à jamais l'univers de la télévision avec sa série \"Twin Peaks\", avant de s'attaquer aux mensonges d’Hollywood dans \"Mulholland Drive\". Retraçant la vie du cinéaste le plus influent de sa génération, ce documentaire explore le sens caché d'une filmographie implacablement cohérente et plonge sous la surface sombre et grouillante de l'American Dream.\r\n\r\nEn 1990, avec Twin Peaks, David Lynch révolutionne l'univers des séries, captivant quelque 34 millions de téléspectateurs à travers le monde. La Palme d'or à Cannes qu'il remporte la même année pour Sailor et Lula achève de révéler ce maître de l'étrange qui intrigue autant que ses films. Comment ce cinéaste en marge d'Hollywood est-il devenu l'un des plus influents de sa génération, imposant sa vision surréaliste sur les écrans mais aussi dans le monde de l'art ? Peintre des profondeurs de l'âme humaine, David Lynch fait une entrée fracassante au cinéma avec deux films désormais cultes : Eraserhead (1977) et Elephant Man (1980). Avec Blue Velvet, il ancre ses images dans la nostalgie de l'enfance et révèle la part d'ombre du rêve américain. À partir de Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me, le génial cinéaste s’emploie à dynamiter les codes de la narration classique pour mieux dénoncer les faux-semblants d'Hollywood dans Lost Highway et Mulholland Drive. Avec bienveillance, David Lynch invite le spectateur/détective à déchiffrer ses intrigues, inscrivant la quête de sens au cœur de l'expérience humaine. En lutte constante pour sa liberté de création, le réalisateur s'affranchira des contraintes d’Hollywood avec l'aide de producteurs français. Avec Inland Empire et surtout Twin Peaks: The Return en 2017, David Lynch repousse alors toutes les limites et interroge la possibilité d'une œuvre expérimentale dans le cinéma contemporain.\n\nJeu(x) de piste\n\nTout au long d'une fascinante enquête, ce documentaire collecte les clés que le réalisateur, disparu le 16 janvier, a semées dans chacun de ses films afin de résoudre l'énigme David Lynch. Au cœur de la célèbre Chambre rouge de Twin Peaks s'ouvre un gigantesque jeu de piste avec, pour principaux guides, ses acteurs fétiches, Laura Dern, Kyle MacLachlan, Isabella Rossellini, Naomi Watts... Un portrait inédit dans lequel témoignent aussi les ex-épouses de l’artiste, la comédienne Peggy Reavey et la monteuse Mary Sweeney, Mel Brooks ou encore Thierry Jousse, pour revisiter son œuvre si singulière, entre mystère et élégance.\r\n\r\nDavid Lynch, une énigme à Hollywood \nDocumentaire de Stéphane Ghez (France, 2024, 1h03mn)\r\n\r\nToute l'actualité du cinéma sur Arte sur :\nhttp://arte.tv/cinema\nhttps://www.facebook.com/artecinema/\n\nSur Facebook : https://www.facebook.com/artetv/\nSur Twitter : https://twitter.com/ARTEfr\nSur Instagram : https://www.instagram.com/artefr/",

        "description": "Documentaire disponible en rediffusion jusqu'au 30/01/2026\n\r\nD'une sensualité affolante, l'interprète inoubliable d'\"Une journée particulière\" incarne l’âge d’or du cinéma italien. Des faubourgs de Naples à Hollywood, retour sur la flamboyante destinée de Sophia Loren.\r\n\r\nNez trop long, hanches trop larges et peau trop foncée, Sophia Loren a imposé sa démesure sur les écrans du monde entier, jusqu'à personnifier l'Italie à elle seule. Née Sofia Scicolone – du nom du père qui l'a abandonnée –, l'enfant illégitime de Naples endure la pauvreté et les quolibets, avant de voir s'épanouir ses formes insensées. Couronnée reine de beauté, dans une robe cousue dans des rideaux, l'adolescente gagne un billet pour Rome où, escortée par sa mère Romilda, actrice aux ambitions mort-nées, elle court sans relâche les castings de Cinecittà. Les cachets des fumetti, des romans-photos, assurent leur quotidien, jusqu'à la rencontre avec Carlo Ponti. Le producteur, marié et de vingt-deux ans son aîné, l'aide à décrocher ses premiers rôles et fait chavirer son cœur. Mais dans l'Italie conservatrice des années 1950, où le divorce est interdit, celle qui se fait désormais appeler Sophia Loren souffre encore d'illégitimité. Entre leur mariage mexicain en 1957, annulé par les autorités italiennes, et la régularisation de leur situation, neuf ans plus tard en France, l'actrice connaît une florissante parenthèse hollywoodienne, pimentée d'une idylle avec Cary Grant.\n\n\n\nHors cadre\n\nC'est sous l'aile protectrice de Vittorio De Sica qu'elle se hisse au sommet du cinéma mondial – remportant le prix d'interprétation à Cannes et l'Oscar de la meilleure actrice pour La ciociara – et inaugure sa mythique collaboration avec Marcello Mastroianni, son partenaire de jeu pendant quatre décennies. Au fil de séduisantes archives, Julia Bracher déroule le destin de la star, devenue actrice comme pour réparer le rêve brisé d'une mère adorée et omniprésente. Des rues miséreuses de Naples aux tapis rouges, de son premier essai à son dernier chef-d'œuvre, Une journée particulière d'Ettore Scola, la réalisatrice explore la trajectoire d'une femme hors cadre qui a mis le monde à ses pieds, en jouant à l'infini avec les stéréotypes de la mère et de la prostituée.\r\n\r\nSophia Loren, une destinée particulière\nDocumentaire de Julia Bracher (France, 2018, 50mn)\r\n\r\n\r\nToute l'actualité du cinéma sur Arte sur :\nhttp://arte.tv/cinema\nhttps://www.facebook.com/artecinema/\n\nSur Facebook : https://www.facebook.com/artetv/\nSur Twitter : https://twitter.com/ARTEfr\nSur Instagram : https://www.instagram.com/artefr/",

        "description": "https://www.arte.tv/fr/videos/126222-000-A/couples-mythiques-du-cinema/\nDocumentaire disponible en rediffusion jusqu'au 10/10/2026\n\r\nKatharine Hepburn et Spencer Tracy formèrent le couple mythique d'Hollywood par excellence à travers neuf films tournés ensemble et un quart de siècle d'amour vécu clandestinement.\r\n\r\nElle a grandi dans une famille aisée et progressiste du New Jersey, il a vécu une enfance turbulente à Milwaukee. L’un comme l’autre ont bataillé pour se faire un nom à Broadway, avant d’être recrutés par les studios hollywoodiens. Mais si Katharine Hepburn se voit immédiatement proposer des rôles sur mesure, en accord avec son charisme atypique, Spencer Tracy, lui, est d’abord cantonné à des personnages de durs. Son passage à la MGM lui permet de révéler d’autres nuances, à l’image de ses prestations dans Capitaines courageux et Des hommes sont nés, qui lui valent deux statuettes du meilleur acteur en 1938 et 1939. Au même moment, la reine de la screwball comedy, elle aussi oscarisée pour Gloire éphémère, connaît une éclipse. Relancée, au début de la décennie suivante, par le succès d’Indiscrétions de George Cukor, elle apporte au patron de la MGM Louis B. Mayer le scénario de La femme de l’année (1942), et suggère le nom de Spencer Tracy pour lui donner la réplique. La magie opère instantanément, au point que le duo se reformera à huit reprises, notamment dans Madame porte la culotte (1949) de Cukor et Devine qui vient dîner... (1967) de Stanley Kramer, l’ultime film de Tracy, décédé peu après le tournage. Entre-temps, ils se seront aimés dans l’ombre pendant un quart de siècle, Katharine Hepburn prenant soin du comédien, marié et père d’un enfant sourd, en proie à une addiction à l’alcool.\r\n\r\nCouples mythiques du cinéma\nDocumentaire d'Anne-Cécile Genre (France, 2016, 52mn)\r\n\r\n\r\nToute l'actualité du cinéma sur Arte sur :\nhttp://arte.tv/cinema\nhttps://www.facebook.com/artecinema/\n\nSur Facebook : https://www.facebook.com/artetv/\nSur Twitter : https://twitter.com/ARTEfr\nSur Instagram : https://www.instagram.com/artefr/",

Une bouleversante adaptation de Zola, signée Jean-Pierre Améris, avec Anaïs Demoustier, rayonnante.\r\n\r\n10 ans, Pauline se retrouve orpheline et hérite de la petite fortune de ses parents commerçants. Elle est accueillie par son oncle et sa tante, les Chanteau, dans leur propriété de la côte normande. Lazare, leur fils de 20 ans, et elle deviennent vite très proches. Mais les études du jeune homme à Paris, les fréquentes visites de Louise, qu'il a rencontrée là-bas, et la convoitise de madame Chanteau vis-à-vis de l'héritage de Pauline vont se dresser entre eux. Amoureuse et généreuse, Pauline n'hésite pas à prêter son argent à Lazare pour rembourser ses dettes et financer un de ses projets, la construction d'une digue. Sans rien attendre en retour, sinon le bonheur de son cousin, fût-ce au prix du sien propre...\n\n\nDévotion\n\n\nDans cette adaptation fidèle du douzième roman de la série des Rougon-Macquart, Jean-Pierre Améris (Les émotifs anonymes) oppose deux personnalités très marquées, aux destins indissolublement liés : Pauline, pleine de bonté et de joie de vivre, et Lazare, le pessimiste, attachant malgré ses faiblesses, qui affirme que \"la vie est inutile, puisque la mort emporte tout\". L'intrigue se construit autour de la dérive progressive de l'amour de Pauline vers la dévotion et le sacrifice de soi. Un récit mélancolique à la chute surprenante, que l'interprétation d'Anaïs Demoustier, rayonnante, rend à la fois vivant et émouvant.\r\n\r\nLa joie de vivre\nTéléfilm de Jean-Pierre Améris (France, 2011, 1h25mn) \r\n\r\n\r\nToute l'actualité du cinéma sur Arte sur :\nhttp://arte.tv/cinema\nhttps://www.facebook.com/artecinema/\n\nSur Facebook : https://www.facebook.com/artetv/\nSur Twitter : https://twitter.com/ARTEfr\nSur Instagram : https://www.instagram.com/artefr/",

        "description": "https://www.arte.tv/fr/videos/078696-000-A/dr-jack-mr-nicholson/\nDocumentaire disponible en rediffusion jusqu'au 14/01/2026\n\r\nD'\"Easy Rider\" à \"Vol au-dessus d'un nid de coucou\", en passant par \"Shining\" et \"Batman\", les rôles les plus fameux de Jack Nicholson font partie de la mémoire collective. Un éclairage aussi foisonnant qu'émouvant du mystère qui se cache derrière le sourire carnassier le plus célèbre d'Hollywood.\r\n\r\nSes rôles les plus fameux font partie de la mémoire collective - même pour ceux qui n'ont pas vu les films - et flirtent presque tous avec la folie : le jeune borderline alcoolo d'Easy Rider, le faux malade mental de Vol au-dessus d'un nid de coucou, le dément meurtrier de Shining, l'hystérique Joker de Batman... Dans l'une des rares interviews au long cours qu'il a accordées (une radio, une vidéo, toutes deux nourrissant ce portrait), Jack Nicholson préfère parler de \"losers\", tous différents, mais racontant chacun un pan de son identité. Car ses films, a-t-il dit aussi, composent pour lui \"une oeuvre secrète, une autobiographie\". Le plus spectaculaire de ces télescopages entre le cinéma et la vraie vie fut peut-être le tournage de Chinatown, en 1974, quand l'enfant sans père du New Jersey, brillante self-made star du Nouvel Hollywood, découvrit dans la presse que sa soeur aînée June était en réalité sa mère, en un troublant écho du scénario.\n\n\n\nL'outsider\n\nEn cinquante ans de carrière, plus de soixante films et trois Oscars, l'acteur, aujourd'hui octogénaire, est devenu depuis longtemps, à l'égal d'un De Niro, une icône du cinéma mondial. Mais si tout le monde a en tête son sourire tour à tour ensorceleur et inquiétant, le mystère d'une personnalité qui s'est soigneusement cachée derrière d'innombrables alter ego est resté presque intact au fil des décennies. L'énigme \"Jack\", jamais tout à fait lui-même, ni tout à fait un autre, est au centre de ce documentaire en forme de jeu de piste. Avec le renfort, notamment, de son biographe Patrick McGilligan, de son vieil ami cinéaste Henry Jaglom, mais aussi de Roger Corman, qui a permis à son talent d'éclore, Emmanuelle Nobécourt propose une analyse convaincante et émouvante d'un éternel outsider, qui se révèle aussi un insatisfait chronique. De son premier rôle au cinéma, en 1958, à son dernier en date, en 2010, elle utilise ses films comme autant d'indices pour faire apparaître la figure tourmentée d'un homme en colère et hanté par l'échec, mais assumant crânement ses fêlures comme son refus obstiné de se trouver là où on l'attend.\r\n\r\nDr. Jack & Mr. Nicholson\nDocumentaire d'Emmanuelle Nobécourt (France, 2018, 54mn)\r\n\r\n\r\nToute l'actualité du cinéma sur Arte sur :\nhttp://arte.tv/cinema\nhttps://www.facebook.com/artecinema/\n\nSur Facebook : https://www.facebook.com/artetv/\nSur Twitter : https://twitter.com/ARTEfr\nSur Instagram : https://www.instagram.com/artefr/",

Pour son premier long métrage, Pierre Linhart (\"Jeux d’influence\") signe un road-movie qui traverse la mémoire de l’esclavage.  \r\n\r\nThibaut a adopté Gabriel lorsqu’il était en poste au mémorial de Gorée. Il a trouvé le nourrisson dans son berceau après qu’Awa, sa femme de ménage, l’a abandonné. Aujourd’hui âgé de 7 ans, le petit garçon, qu’il élève seul, est en proie à la mélancolie et dessine continuellement une silhouette noire avec des dreadlocks. Comprenant que Gabriel souhaite se rapprocher de sa mère biologique, Thibaut lui propose de se rendre sur l’île sénégalaise à la recherche d’Awa. Mais est-ce bien d’elle dont Gabriel a besoin ?  \n\n\n\nUne filiation morcelée \n\nD’où venons-nous ? Après la série Jeux d’influence dont il est coauteur, Pierre Linhart passe pour la première fois derrière la caméra et aborde cette question existentielle à travers une quête des origines aux allures de récit d’apprentissage. À la recherche de sa mère, Gabriel retourne sur l’île de Gorée, ancien marché d’esclaves et désormais site touristique emblématique du Sénégal. Sur les traces du passé de la traite négrière, ce road-movie pousse avec sensibilité ses personnages dans un nécessaire travail de mémoire et interroge la possibilité du pardon – à l’image d’une bouleversante rencontre devant la porte du Non-Retour, au Bénin, entre Miles, amant afro-américain de Thibaut et descendant d’esclaves, et Martine, héritière d’une lignée de négriers. Pour Gabriel, cette histoire s’avère avant tout celle d’une filiation morcelée, tandis que Thibaut (Jean Le Peltier, très touchant) peine à assumer pleinement son rôle de père adoptif. Subsiste alors un manque que seule une famille recomposée, homoparentale et interethnique, peut aider à combler, et au sein de laquelle chacun doit trouver sa place.\r\n\r\n\nUn autre père \nTéléfilm de Pierre Linhart (France, 2025, 1h30mn)\n\n#artecinema #filmcomplet \r\nToute l'actualité du cinéma sur Arte sur :\nhttp://arte.tv/cinema\nhttps://www.facebook.com/artecinema/\n\nSur Facebook : https://www.facebook.com/artetv/\nSur Twitter : https://twitter.com/ARTEfr\nSur Instagram : https://www.instagram.com/artefr/",

Entre l'intello new-yorkaise et le \"King of cool\", rongé par ses démons, l'attraction est immédiate. Pendant cinq ans, ils vont partager une passion aussi brûlante que destructrice, adoptant le mode de vie hippie et ses excès.\r\n\r\nRévélé par la série télévisée Au nom de la loi, Steve McQueen s'impose sur grand écran avec Les sept mercenaires (1960) de John Sturges. Celui qui fut voyou, bûcheron, docker ou encore vendeur d'encyclopédies enchaîne dès lors les succès : La grande évasion, Le Kid de Cincinnati, La canonnière du Yang-Tsé ou encore Bullit, qui fait de lui une star internationale à l'aube des seventies. Comme nombre de jeunes femmes issues de familles aisées, Ali MacGraw, de son côté, s'est d'abord tournée vers la mode. Devenue mannequin après avoir été l'assistante de Diana Vreeland, la patronne du prestigieux Harper's Bazaar, elle est repérée par un agent qui lui ouvre les portes de Hollywood. L'immense popularité du mélo Love Story (1970), illuminé par sa beauté naturelle en phase avec l'époque, lui apporte la gloire en même temps qu'elle relance la Paramount, alors proche de la faillite. Mariée au vice-président du studio Robert Evans, l'actrice donne ensuite la réplique à Steve McQueen dans Guet-apens (1972) de Sam Peckinpah.

        "description": "Documentaire disponible en rediffusion jusqu'au 21/03/2026 \n\r\nAntithèse des héros virils de son époque, James Dean a bousculé les codes du masculin en l'espace de trois films. Soixante-dix ans après sa disparition, à l'âge de 24 ans, ce portrait lui redonne chair en entrelaçant ses mots, et ceux de son entourage, avec de fascinantes archives.\r\n\r\nLe 30 septembre 1955, James Dean, filant vers Salinas pour prendre le départ d’une course automobile, était fauché en pleine gloire dans un accident de la route. Avant la tragédie, qui a scellé sa légende, l’acteur aura néanmoins donné corps, avec une brûlante intensité, aux doutes, révoltes et aspirations d’une jeunesse déboussolée. Sur petit écran d’abord, dans des séries télévisées comme A Long Time Till Dawn, puis au cinéma, à travers trois films tournés en moins de deux ans : À l’est d’Éden d’Elia Kazan, La fureur de vivre de Nicholas Ray et Géant de George Stevens. Tour à tour fils incompris, ado en rébellion et cow-boy devenu magnat du pétrole, celui qui passa par l’Actors Studio a injecté dans chacun de ses rôles ses propres blessures, héritées de l’enfance. Car \"Jimmy\" a été privé à 9 ans de l'amour protecteur de sa mère, emportée par un cancer. Élevé par sa tante dans une ferme de l’Indiana, il n'a cessé de chercher la reconnaissance de son père, pour qui jouer la comédie n’était pas “un métier d’homme”.\n\n\n\nÀ fleur de peau\n\nDans sa vie comme à l'écran, à travers ses personnages d’adolescent à fleur de peau, qui ont fait de lui l’icône d’une génération, James Dean a bouleversé la représentation de la masculinité en mettant à nu ses fragilités. Soixante-dix ans après sa mort, Cyril Leuthy (Godard – Seul le cinéma) entreprend d’approcher l’homme derrière le mythe en s’appuyant sur ses propres mots et sur les souvenirs de celles et ceux qui l’ont côtoyé (famille, amis, réalisateurs et acteurs avec qui il a tourné...). Ce récit choral, porté par les voix de comédiens habités, s’entremêle avec des extraits savamment choisis de ses films, dans lesquels il a mis tant de lui, et un riche fonds d’archives. On y découvre d’authentiques trésors, à l’instar d’une corrida – l’une de ses passions – animée image par image, qu’il a tournée avec des figurines, ou d’un essai filmé avec Sal Mineo pour La fureur de vivre, dans lequel les deux comédiens poussent l’ambiguïté sexuelle au-delà de ce qui était montrable en espérant contourner la censure. Un portrait intime, charnel et poétique, qui rend hommage à la modernité d'un acteur incandescent dont la sensibilité crève l’écran.\r\n\r\nJames Dean : le nouvel homme\nDocumentaire de Cyril Leuthy (France, 2025, 1h01mn)\r\n\r\n\r\nToute l'actualité du cinéma sur Arte sur :\nhttp://arte.tv/cinema\nhttps://www.facebook.com/artecinema/\n\nSur Facebook : https://www.facebook.com/artetv/\nSur Twitter : https://twitter.com/ARTEfr\nSur Instagram : https://www.instagram.com/artefr/",

D’après Stephen King, un thriller claustrophobe qui se concentre sur le duel psychologique opposant l’écrivain affaibli (James Caan), cherchant à fuir par tous les moyens, et sa geôlière psychopathe, admirablement interprétée par Kathy Bates (Oscar de la meilleure actrice).\r\n\r\nPaul Sheldon vient de mettre le point final à sa saga à succès, Misery, en sacrifiant son héroïne. Satisfait, il quitte l’hôtel de montagne où il séjournait pour rejoindre New York. Sur la route, aveuglé par le blizzard, il est victime d’un grave accident de voiture. Une infirmière à la retraite, qui habite une maison isolée, le recueille. Paul découvre bientôt que sa bienfaitrice, aux petits soins pour lui, est l’une de ses plus ferventes lectrices. Mais quand Annie Wilkes apprend la mort de son idole en parcourant les pages du manuscrit transporté par l’écrivain, elle change radicalement de comportement pour se muer en tortionnaire inflexible...\n\n\nSuspense étouffant\n\nAprès Stand by me, Rob Reiner transpose une nouvelle fois à l’écran un roman de Stephen King. Dépouillé de ses scènes de torture les plus violentes – si l’on occulte le fameux passage des chevilles brisées à coups de massue –, le film se concentre sur le duel psychologique opposant l’écrivain affaibli, cherchant à fuir par tous les moyens, et sa geôlière psychopathe, admirablement interprétée par Kathy Bates, qui a reçu l’Oscar de la meilleure actrice pour cette terrifiante composition. Le chalet de l’infirmière, cerné de vastes étendues immaculées, devient ainsi le théâtre d’un huis clos au réalisme anxiogène, fidèle à l’univers du maître du frisson américain.\r\n\r\nMisery \nFilm de Rob Reiner (États-Unis, 1990, 1h43mn)\r\n\r\n\r\nToute l'actualité du cinéma sur Arte sur :\nhttp://arte.tv/cinema\nhttps://www.facebook.com/artecinema/\n\nSur Facebook : https://www.facebook.com/artetv/\nSur Twitter : https://twitter.com/ARTEfr\nSur Instagram : https://www.instagram.com/artefr/",

Ursula Meier (\"Home\") explore l’impossibilité d’aimer dans ce film saisissant porté par Valeria Bruni Tedeschi et Stéphanie Blanchoud.\r\n\r\nSujette à des comportements violents qui lui ont coûté sa relation amoureuse avec Julien, Margaret, 35 ans, est retournée vivre chez sa mère, Christina, qui lui reproche d’avoir ruiné, en venant au monde, sa prometteuse carrière de pianiste. Au cours d’une dispute, Margaret frappe si violemment Christina au visage que cette dernière assure être devenue sourde d’une oreille. Convoquée chez le juge, Margaret se voit interdire d’entrer en contact avec sa mère et d’approcher à moins de 100 mètres de son domicile. Pour la forcer à respecter ce périmètre, sa petite sœur, Marion, trace une ligne bleue au sol tout autour de leur maison. Mais Margaret revient jour après jour sur cette frontière qui la sépare des siens...\n\nSur le fil\n\nAprès L’enfant d’en haut (2012), Ursula Meier explore de nouveau les liens dysfonctionnels au sein d’une cellule familiale. Sans filtre ni tact, Christina (Valeria Bruni Tedeschi – presque aussi barrée que dans La fracture de Catherine Corsini) complique le quotidien de ses trois filles : Margaret, l’aînée chanteuse (Stéphanie Blanchoud, d’une intensité de jeu rare) qu’elle tient responsable de sa carrière ratée, Louise, sa pragmatique cadette (India Hair), jugée dépourvue de toute fibre artistique et donc d’intérêt, et sa petite dernière (Elli Spagnolo), contrainte malgré son jeune âge à faire preuve d’une troublante maturité. Comme dans Home (2008), où la proximité d’une autoroute rendait le cocon invivable, la réalisatrice helvète prend la maison comme un point de cristallisation des tensions et des incompréhensions mutuelles. Auprès d’hommes semblant n’être que de passage (Benjamin Biolay, Éric Ruf, Dali Benssalah), les femmes se révèlent aussi fragiles qu’elles sont enferrées dans une violence destructrice. Constamment sur le fil entre comédie et drame, un film saisissant autour de l’impossibilité de s’aimer soi-même et d’aimer les autres.\r\n\r\nLa ligne\nFilm d'Ursula Meier (2022, 1h38mn)\r\n\r\nToute l'actualité du cinéma sur Arte sur :\nhttp://arte.tv/cinema\nhttps://www.facebook.com/artecinema/\n\nSur Facebook : https://www.facebook.com/artetv/\nSur Twitter : https://twitter.com/ARTEfr\nSur Instagram : https://www.instagram.com/artefr/",

Avec une approche réaliste, Louis Daquin rend hommage aux gueules noires et offre son premier rôle au cinéma à Michel Piccoli.\r\n\r\nPas-de-Calais, après la Seconde Guerre mondiale. Jeune ingénieur, Larzac vient d’être nommé dans le bassin minier de Lens. Amenant de Paris ses idées progressistes, il supporte mal les méthodes autoritaires et conservatrices de Dubard, son supérieur. Contraint de rentrer dans son pays, le Polonais Brezza voudrait se marier avant son départ avec Louise Gohelle. Georges, le frère de cette dernière, espère, lui, passer la bague au doigt de Marie Bréhard. Employée au triage à la mine, celle-ci n’accepte pas d’arrêter de travailler après leur mariage, ce que ne conçoit pas Georges. Roger, le petit frère de Marie, vient de fêter ses 14 ans, l’âge auquel tous les jeunes de la région descendent dans la mine…\n \n Dignité et combat \n Ancien résistant aux côtés du parti communiste et figure engagée du mouvement syndical, Louis Daquin laisse s’exprimer sa fibre militante dans ce film où il rend hommage aux gueules noires – auxquelles il venait d’ailleurs de consacrer La grande lutte des mineurs, un court métrage documentaire sur les grèves des années 1940 qui fut interdit de diffusion par arrêté ministériel en 1948. Témoignant avec une approche réaliste et quasi documentaire de leurs dures conditions de vie, mais aussi de leur dignité et de leurs combats, le réalisateur dut affronter la censure de Charbonnages de France, qui avait facilité son tournage, et fut contraint d’accepter de multiples modifications et coupes, notamment relatives à la catastrophe de Courrières (1906). Si Le point du jour donna un coup de frein à la carrière de Louis Daquin – il eut dans les années 1950 le plus grand mal à financer ses projets en France –, il permit au jeune acteur Michel Piccoli, passionné de théâtre, de décrocher son premier rôle au cinéma. Daquin et lui se sont retrouvés peu après sur Le parfum de la dame en noir, sorti lui aussi en 1949.\n\r\n\r\nLe point du jour\nFilm de Louis Daquin (France, 1949, 1h39mn)\n\r\nToute l'actualité du cinéma sur Arte sur :\nhttp://arte.tv/cinema\nhttps://www.facebook.com/artecinema/\n\nSur Facebook : https://www.facebook.com/artetv/\nSur Twitter : https://twitter.com/ARTEfr\nSur Instagram : https://www.instagram.com/artefr/",

Révélés au grand public par leur deuxième long métrage Arizona Junior (1987) avant d’enchaîner les succès, les deux frères ont inventé au fil de leur riche carrière un langage cinématographique qui n’appartient qu’à eux. Revisitant tous les genres – thriller, comédie, drame, western, comédie musicale ou film d'espionnage – à coup de scénarios décapants et de dialogues millimétrés, ils ont créé un monde peuplé d'imbéciles et de rêveurs, de meurtriers et de moralistes, portant un regard cynique et désopilant sur l’American way of life.

        "description": "Documentaire disponible en rediffusion jusqu'au 06/03/2026\n\r\nRetraçant quarante ans de carrière de Joel et Ethan Coen, un portrait truffé d’entretiens inédits avec plusieurs de leurs acteurs fétiches (George Clooney, Jeff Bridges, Tilda Swinton, John Malkovich...), qui décryptent avec humour leur méthode de travail. \r\n\r\nDepuis plus de quarante ans, Joel et Ethan Coen fascinent et déconcertent les cinéphiles. Révélés au grand public par leur deuxième long métrage Arizona Junior (1987) avant d’enchaîner les succès, les deux frères ont inventé au fil de leur riche carrière un langage cinématographique qui n’appartient qu’à eux. Revisitant tous les genres – thriller, comédie, drame, western, comédie musicale ou film d'espionnage – à coup de scénarios décapants et de dialogues millimétrés, ils ont créé un monde peuplé d'imbéciles et de rêveurs, de meurtriers et de moralistes, portant un regard cynique et désopilant sur l’American way of life. Ensemble, ils ont remporté pratiquement toutes les distinctions possibles : quatre Oscars et deux Bafta Awards (pour Fargo et No Country for Old Men), une Palme d'or en 1991 pour Barton Fink, sans compter les nombreux prix décernés par la critique.

        "description": "Portrait d'une \"gueule\" danoise devenue star internationale, aimant à égale mesure les rôles à la psychologie complexe et les films physiques où son corps d'ex-danseur parle pour lui.\r\n\r\nEn 2006, Mads Mikkelsen atteint la célébrité internationale avec son rôle de sadique glacé dans l’opus Casino Royale de la franchise James Bond. À 40 ans, il devient subitement le \"Danois le plus célèbre du monde\", comme le titre la presse. Mais au Danemark, l'acteur est déjà un héros national. Il y a débuté en 1995 devant la caméra de Nicolas Winding Refn dans le rôle d'un dealer minable pour Pusher, ovni cinématographique qui contribuera, en parallèle à la déclaration d'intention \"Dogme 95\" (pour un cinéma brut, authentique) de Lars Von Trier et Thomas Vinterberg, à faire éclore une nouvelle génération.\n\nIssu d'un quartier populaire de Copenhague, le jeune Mikkelsen – dont le frère Lars est aussi un acteur célèbre – a entamé son parcours artistique par la gymnastique, puis la danse, qu'il a pratiquée neuf ans sur toutes les scènes du Danemark, avant d'être frappé par la vocation lors de son \"cinquième visionnage\" de Taxi Driver. Sa condition physique irréprochable et son amour des cascades seront un cadeau pour l'industrie hollywoodienne où le film d'action est roi. L'acteur consacre l’autre moitié de son planning aux rôles à la psychologie complexe, irradiant d'une \"puissance érotique dans le supplice et la victimisation\", selon le réalisateur Arnaud de Pallières, qu’il soit d'un côté de la violence (la série Hannibal) comme de l'autre (Michael Kohlhaas). En 2012, il obtient le prix de la meilleure interprétation masculine au Festival de Cannes pour La chasse, de Thomas Vinterberg, où il interprète un éducateur soupçonné de pédophilie. La documentariste Jeanne Burel brosse le portrait d'un comédien fascinant, qui a brisé sa beauté aux arêtes d'un cinéma danois versé dans l'étrange et l'inquiétant, avant d'être accueilli à bras ouverts par Hollywood.\r\n\r\nDocumentaire de Jeanne Burel (France, 2024, 53mn)\r disponible jusqu'au 17/03/2026.\n\r\nRetrouvez aussi Mads Mikkelsen vu par Blow up ! https://youtu.be/qjn0rnRHf2w\n\nAbonnez vous à la chaîne : https://www.youtube.com/@artecinemafr\n\nSuivez-nous sur les réseaux sociaux !\nInstagram : https://www.instagram.com/artefr\nMais aussi pour nos séries courtes : https://www.instagram.com/arte_asuivre/\nTikTok : https://www.tiktok.com/@artefr/\nTwitch : https://www.twitch.tv/artefr\nBluesky : https://bsky.app/profile/artefr.bsky.social\nFacebook : http://www.facebook.com/artetv",

Suleyman y fait la connaissance d'Ibrahim, un guetteur de 16 ans en liberté conditionnelle qui travaille lui aussi pour Kader. D'abord méfiants l'un envers l'autre, ils nouent peu à peu des liens inattendus de réconfort et de soutien.\n\n\nQuotidien sur le fil\n\nPour certains, il y a l’Angleterre où l’on rejoindra bientôt la jolie fille avec qui on échange sur un réseau social (\"Rêve pas, ta nana, c’est un brouteur en Afrique\", lui assène un autre). Pour Suleyman, qui a laissé son fils derrière lui au Sénégal, il y a l’espoir d’obtenir des papiers. Pour Ibrahim, celui plus prosaïque d’échapper à la police pour continuer d’aider sa mère. Après avoir coréalisé Talion (2015), un court métrage sélectionné et récompensé dans de nombreux festivals, Mehdi Hamnane et son frère Yanis, tous deux formés à l’École supérieure de réalisation audiovisuelle (ESRA), se retrouvent pour raconter le quotidien sur le fil, entre solidarité, précarité et peur de l’expulsion, d’un déraciné confronté à la clandestinité.

Une puissante leçon d’histoire par un des maîtres du cinéma italien.\r\n\r\nPendant l’occupation, à Rome, les membres du Comité de libération nationale, regroupant des partis et des mouvements d’opposition au fascisme, cherchent à maintenir l’unité dans leurs rangs en dépit des dissensions internes. Parmi les têtes pensantes du Comité, l’homme politique Alcide De Gasperi interroge la légitimité des récents attentats commis par les communistes et s’engage au sein du nouveau parti clandestin Démocratie chrétienne, fondé par d’anciens membres du Parti populaire italien. Après la chute de Mussolini et la victoire des Alliés sur les forces d’occupation allemande, la Démocratie chrétienne se montre à visage découvert…\n\n\n\nCinéma pédagogique\n\nRécemment restauré, L’an un retrace dix années cruciales de l'histoire italienne, de la fin de la Seconde Guerre mondiale à la reconstruction du pays, à travers la figure clé de l'homme d'État démocrate-chrétien Alcide De Gasperi (1881-1954), premier chef de gouvernement de l'Italie républicaine de 1945 à 1953 et l’un des pères fondateurs de l’Union européenne. Avant-dernier film de Rossellini, conçu dans le cadre de ses films didactiques pour la télévision dans les années 1970, L’an un adopte un registre rigoureusement sobre et pédagogique, proche du documentaire, les dialogues étant pour la plupart tirés de documents historiques. Entrecoupé de scènes de champ de bataille, le film s’attache à montrer les efforts déployés par De Gasperi et ses homologues pour instaurer une démocratie face aux communistes, aux monarchistes et aux pressions des Alliés, du référendum de 1946 à l’élaboration de la Constitution de la République italienne. Ce cinéma moral et politique offre des outils de compréhension du monde et demeure puissamment d’actualité à l’heure où les démocraties occidentales se voient fragilisées par les montées des extrémismes.\r\n\nL'an un (Anno uno)\nFilm de Roberto Rossellini (France, 2021, 1h42mn)\n\nToute l'actualité du cinéma sur Arte sur :\nhttp://arte.tv/cinema\nhttps://www.facebook.com/artecinema/\n\nSur Facebook : https://www.facebook.com/artetv/\nSur Twitter : https://twitter.com/ARTEfr\nSur Instagram : https://www.instagram.com/artefr/",

Avec Anna Magnani, le chef-d'oeuvre tragique de Roberto Rossellini, qui a marqué en 1945 l’avènement du néoréalisme. Présenté en version restaurée.\r\n\r\nRome, début 1944. La Gestapo perquisitionne un immeuble où vit Giorgio Manfredi, le chef communiste d'un réseau de résistance. Il s'échappe par les toits et se réfugie chez son ami Francesco, typographe et lui aussi résistant, sur le point de se marier le lendemain avec Pina, une jeune veuve mère d’un petit garçon. Le prêtre de la paroisse, don Pietro, qui cache un déserteur autrichien, vient en aide au partisan traqué. Mais la maîtresse toxicomane de ce dernier, Marina, a pour pourvoyeuse de drogue une aventurière allemande qui travaille en secret pour les nazis...  \n\n\nAuthenticité  \n\nÉcrit en 1944, alors que Rome était encore sous le joug nazi, ce chef-d’œuvre de Roberto Rossellini, présenté en version restaurée, marque l’avènement éclatant du néoréalisme. Tourné dès la fin de la guerre dans les rues de la ville, malgré un financement précaire et de fortes pressions politiques, le film s’inscrit dans le style quasi documentaire qui caractérise la révolution esthétique et narrative inaugurée par Roberto Rossellini. Après Paisà, son terrible Allemagne, année zéro en constituera en 1948 un autre sommet. Malgré un accueil mitigé à domicile, l’enthousiasme du Festival de Cannes, qui lui accorde son grand prix, consacre rapidement Rome, ville ouverte comme un classique. Au plus près de la véracité historique et humaine de ses personnages, le cinéaste magnifie à travers eux le sursaut collectif d’un peuple.\r\n\r\nRome, ville ouverte (Roma, Citta Aperta)\nFilm de Roberto Rossellini (Italie, 1945, 1h39mn)\r\n\r\nToute l'actualité du cinéma sur Arte sur :\nhttp://arte.tv/cinema\nhttps://www.facebook.com/artecinema/\n\nSur Facebook : https://www.facebook.com/artetv/\nSur Twitter : https://twitter.com/ARTEfr\nSur Instagram : https://www.instagram.com/artefr/",

Star hollywoodienne, la Suédoise Ingrid Bergman a imposé sa grâce naturelle dans des succès tels que Casablanca, Pour qui sonne le glas ou Hantise, qui lui a valu un Oscar en 1944. Roberto Rossellini, lui, a révolutionné le septième art en donnant naissance au néoréalisme italien avec Rome, ville ouverte. Ayant découvert ce chef-d'œuvre dans une salle new-yorkaise, puis vécu le même choc devant Paisà, l’actrice écrit son admiration au cinéaste romain, qui lui rend visite à Londres sur le tournage des Amants du Capricorne d’Alfred Hitchcock. Immédiatement séduit, il lui propose le rôle principal de Stromboli, dévolu à Anna Magnani. C’est sur l’île volcanique, quelques mois plus tard, qu’Ingrid Bergman, mariée et mère d’une petite fille – Pia Lindström, qui témoigne dans ce documentaire –, se découvre enceinte du réalisateur. Elle l’épouse en 1950 malgré le scandale, Hollywood ne lui pardonnant pas d’avoir abandonné sa famille et sa carrière pour s’épanouir en Europe. Le couple aura deux autres enfants, dont Isabella Rossellini, et tournera Europe 51, Voyage en Italie, La peur et Jeanne au bûcher, avant de se séparer, dans la douleur, en 1957.\r\n\r\nCouples mythiques du cinéma\nDocumentaire de Bertrand Tessier (France, 2018, 52mn)\r\n\r\nToute l'actualité du cinéma sur Arte sur :\nhttp://arte.tv/cinema\nhttps://www.facebook.com/artecinema/\n\nSur Facebook : https://www.facebook.com/artetv/\nSur Twitter : https://twitter.com/ARTEfr\nSur Instagram : https://www.instagram.com/artefr/",

Ils partent vivre à Stromboli, l’île volcanique dont est originaire le jeune homme... Avec Ingrid Bergman, fascinante, une oeuvre intense de Roberto Rossellini qui frappe par sa modernité. \r\n\r\nAu lendemain de la Seconde Guerre mondiale, en Italie. Internée pour avoir eu une liaison avec un Allemand, Karin, une jeune Lituanienne, vient de voir sa demande de visa pour l’Argentine rejetée. Pour échapper aux conditions de vie épouvantables du camp, elle se résout à épouser un jeune pêcheur italien. Après leur mariage, ils partent pour Stromboli, l’île volcanique dont est originaire le jeune homme. Mais l’incompréhension va séparer le couple : Karin se sent oppressée par la nature hostile et peine à s’intégrer dans un milieu dont elle ignore les règles... \n\nTerre lointaine \n\nD’abord écrit pour Anna Magnani, le rôle échut à Ingrid Bergman, qui avait envoyé une lettre admirative à Roberto Rossellini après avoir vu Rome ville ouverte. La maîtrise du cinéaste, le montage alternant les séquences documentaires (une impitoyable pêche au thon) et des éclats de pure fiction font de Stromboli un film d’une force peu commune. Ce qui frappe aujourd’hui, c’est la façon magistrale dont le cinéaste filme l’immobilité. Rossellini use avec circonspection du spectaculaire : un parti pris de discrétion plus plastique que dramatique, car l’histoire joue sur une dimension métaphysique qui s’exacerbe lors des dernières séquences. Livrée à elle-même sur une île-prison, Karin souffre d’être différente et abandonnée, et s’en remettra au Christ pour changer le cours de son destin.

Retour sur ce parcours unique à travers un portrait qui explore toute la complexité du mythe.\r\n\r\nUn visage anguleux sillonné par les rides, le regard froncé sous le chapeau, souligné par un rictus reconnaissable entre mille : cette image appartient désormais à l’imaginaire collectif. Si elle semble immémoriale, elle est en réalité moins figée qu’il n’y paraît. Du ténébreux cow-boy de ses débuts télévisés au mercenaire cynique des westerns de Sergio Leone, du flic tordu de Dirty Harry au photographe romantique de Sur la route de Madison, et jusqu’au vieil homme de ses derniers films, Clint Eastwood a incarné un éventail de personnages surprenant… tout en restant lui-même. Son parcours est à son image : en mouvement, ouvert aux chemins de traverse, libre et riche de multiples facettes.\n\n\n\nCoup de jeune pour le vieux Clint\n\nC’est un drôle de paradoxe. Clint Eastwood est une légende, sans aucun doute. Mais à plus de 90 ans, il continue de tourner, bon an mal an, se rappelant régulièrement à notre souvenir, faisant toujours partie de notre paysage. Si bien qu’on en oublie parfois le mythe… Le documentaire de Clélia Cohen vient lui donner un coup de jeune bienvenu en remontant à la source. Au son des musiques qui ont accompagné ses métamorphoses, l'icône reprend vie à travers un réjouissant montage d’extraits de films, de reportages et d’interviews d’époque qui mettent en relief les aspects exemplaires de son parcours, comme ses ambiguïtés. La route, le jazz, l’humour, la quête d’une communauté harmonieuse croisent la violence, la solitude et la conscience du vieillissement dans un portrait passionné qui rappelle l’importance de son œuvre humaniste, antimanichéenne, marquée par un mélange unique de classicisme et de modernité.\r\n\r\nClint Eastwood, la dernière légende\nDocumentaire de Clélia Cohen (France, 2022, 1h18mn)\r\n\r\n\r\nToute l'actualité du cinéma sur Arte sur :\nhttp://arte.tv/cinema\nhttps://www.facebook.com/artecinema/\n\nSur Facebook : https://www.facebook.com/artetv/\nSur Twitter : https://twitter.com/ARTEfr\nSur Instagram : https://www.instagram.com/artefr/",

Les revenus que les habitants tirent de la pêche sont maigres, alimentant désordres sociaux et dissensions, qui ne semblent pouvoir être réglés que par un miracle. Celui-ci se présente justement le soir même de la fête, quand un mystérieux vieillard frappe à la porte de l’honnête Celestino, photographe, et dote le brave homme, dépité par l’égoïsme et la mesquinerie de son entourage, du pouvoir d’éliminer les malfaisants d’une simple pression sur le déclencheur de son appareil… \"Un bon qui n’agit pas devient complice du méchant\", l’encourage cet homme en qui Celestino voit saint André réincarné. N’y croyant qu’à moitié, le photographe teste sa machine pour en constater la redoutable efficacité. D’abord terrifié par ce pouvoir, il se résout à l’embrasser tout à fait pour le bien de la communauté. Mais à y regarder de plus près, bons et méchants ne sont pas si faciles à différencier…\n \n Commedia dell’arte\n Dans ce long métrage oublié, qui détonne dans la filmographie de Roberto Rossellini, le réalisateur s’autorise une rare et réjouissante incursion dans le genre de la comédie. Dès le prologue, le ton est donné : une main – celle du metteur en scène ou celle du Créateur – dispose le décor d’une petite scène de théâtre, annonçant un conte moral dans la droite veine des farces de la commedia dell’arte. Mais l’auteur de Rome, ville ouverte n’abandonne pas pour autant sa veine néoréaliste, posant son regard sur les rues d’Amalfi et ses escaliers, qui séparent les bourgeois de la ville haute du petit peuple de la ville basse – et représentent l’un des grands ressorts comiques du film. Dans cette satire sociale étirée jusqu’au burlesque, chacun en prend pour son grade : politiciens véreux, usurière aigrie, couple de Roméo et Juliette au rabais, jusqu’au policier compromis avec le pouvoir mussolinien, figé dans la mort dans un ultime salut fasciste, ou l’ancien GI en goguette avec sa famille, qui espère ouvrir un hôtel de luxe sur le cimetière où finira tout ce beau monde…\r\n\nLa machine à tuer les méchants (La macchina ammazzacattivi)\nFilm de Roberto Rossellini (Italie, 1948, 1h22mn)\n\r\nToute l'actualité du cinéma sur Arte sur :\nhttp://arte.tv/cinema\nhttps://www.facebook.com/artecinema/\n\nSur Facebook : https://www.facebook.com/artetv/\nSur Twitter : https://twitter.com/ARTEfr\nSur Instagram : https://www.instagram.com/artefr/",

Roberto Rossellini offre à son épouse, l’incandescente Ingrid Bergman, l’un de ses plus beaux rôles, dans une œuvre à la mise en scène épurée et d’une époustouflante beauté visuelle.\r\n\r\nUn soir, dans une ville allemande, Irene Wagner, une femme mariée à un éminent scientifique, rencontre en secret Erich Baumann, son amant et jeune musicien de renom, pour lui signifier qu’elle souhaite mettre un terme à leur liaison adultère. De retour chez elle, une inconnue nommée Johanna Schultze l’aborde sans ménagement. Ancienne petite amie d’Erich, Johanna l’accuse de lui avoir dérobé l’amour de sa vie et réclame compensation. Embarrassée, redoutant que son mari ne découvre sa liaison, Irene consent à recevoir la jeune femme dans l’usine qu’elle dirige. Johanna débute alors un dangereux chantage, tandis que chez Irene, la peur s’installe…\n \n Montée d’angoisse\n Dernier des cinq films du couple Roberto Rossellini-Ingrid Bergman, inspiré d’une nouvelle de Stefan Zweig, La peur décrypte de manière clinique les sentiments de crainte et de culpabilité qui rongent la solide femme d’affaires Irene Wagner, victime d’une maître-chanteuse. Mais qui trompe qui dans cet univers policé de la bourgeoisie allemande ? D’une grande force esthétique avec sa mise en scène épurée et son magnifique noir et blanc, le film interroge notamment les valeurs du couple et de la famille. Dans une atmosphère oppressante, en lieux clos, Ingrid Bergman, au visage cadré en gros plan, excelle dans le rôle de cette femme ambiguë, désemparée, dont les failles intimes se laissent découvrir à mesure que l’angoisse et la peur la suffoquent. Tourné avec plusieurs fins différentes, certaines plus pessimistes que d’autres, selon les versions distribuées en Allemagne et en Italie, La peur, en restituant au plus près les tourments d’une femme adultère, demeure une œuvre phare, d’une grande puissance émotionnelle.\n\nLa peur (La paura)\nFilm de Roberto Rossellini (Allemagne, 1954, 1h20mn)\n\r\nToute l'actualité du cinéma sur Arte sur :\nhttp://arte.tv/cinema\nhttps://www.facebook.com/artecinema/\n\nSur Facebook : https://www.facebook.com/artetv/\nSur Twitter : https://twitter.com/ARTEfr\nSur Instagram : https://www.instagram.com/artefr/",

Avec Irène Jacob et la jeune Adèle Haenel, une fiction engagée sur les combats de trois générations de femmes.\r\n\r\nLucie, 19 ans, est stagiaire à la Télévision suisse romande. Un jour, dans les images d'archives du mouvement féministe genevois des années 1970, elle est frappée par le visage d'une militante qui ressemble étrangement au sien. Quand elle évoque ce sosie devant ses grands-parents, leur soudaine nervosité lui fait comprendre que sa famille cache un lourd secret. Menant l'enquête avec sa jeune sœur rebelle, malgré les réticences de leur mère, elle reconstitue l'histoire de Geneviève, leur véritable grand-mère, figure du mouvement féministe des années 1970. Lorsque Lucie se découvre enceinte de son ex-petit ami, qui lui propose le mariage, le combat de Geneviève lui apparaît comme la clé de son passé et de son futur de femme.\n\nFéministes de mère en fille\nPrimé dans plusieurs festivals, le film dépeint avec justesse les tourments, les joies et les idéaux de trois générations de femmes.

        "title": "Charles Bronson, le génie du mâle | Documentaire | ARTE Cinema",
        "description": "Documentaire disponible en rediffusion jusqu'au 31/03/2026\n\r\nLe portrait tout en muscles et en moustache de l'acteur Charles Bronson (1921-2003), un paradoxe aussi attachant que taiseux, devenu malgré lui l'icône d'une Amérique violente et paranoïaque.\r\n\r\n\"Ce que je suis devenu me déçoit.\" Dans la vie comme dans les films, Charles Bronson, né Buchinsky, parlait peu, mais franc. Quand il se confie ainsi à la presse, en 1975, il vient pourtant, à 54 ans, de conquérir une gloire hollywoodienne qu'il aura poursuivie durant près de trente ans. Peut-être pressent-il que son rôle de flingueur dans l’instantanément culte Death Wish (Un justicier dans la ville) va l'enfermer peu à peu dans une caricature de lui-même. Jusqu'à incarner, longtemps après sa mort, en 2003, l'icône d'une Amérique machiste, violente et paranoïaque, invoquée par Donald Trump dans ses meetings de campagne. Cogneur mélancolique, vedette mondiale boudée à domicile, mineur fils de mineur devenu l'acteur le mieux payé au monde, amoureux fervent abonné aux rôles de solitaires : l'inoubliable vengeur d'Il était une fois dans l'Ouest a porté ses contradictions avec le flegme impénétrable qui l’a rendu si magnétique à l'écran.\n\n\nCarapace \n\nCe n'est pas le moindre des plaisirs procurés par ces retrouvailles avec la moustache la plus populaire du cinéma américain (après celle de Clark Gable) que de voir défiler les personnages incarnés par \"Charlie\" au fil des décennies. Ils se fondent dans la mémoire de générations de spectateurs en un même héros, aussi viril, sombre et taiseux qu'expéditif. Après une carrière de prolétaire étonnamment riche en avatars (qu'il énumère avec humour dans une archive savoureuse), des débuts laborieux de méchant à tout faire et une percée remarquée dans le film d'action (Les douze salopards, Les sept mercenaires, La grande évasion, mais aussi beaucoup de rôles d'Indiens, \"cousins\" par les origines \"mongoles\" de ce fils d'immigrés lituaniens), c'est en Europe qu'il devient d'abord célèbre : face à Delon dans Adieu l'ami, à Marlène Jobert dans Le passager de la pluie, puis en homme blessé qui n’a rien à perdre, en 1968, dans le chef-d'œuvre de Sergio Leone, Il était une fois dans l'Ouest. Un autre Italien, Dino De Laurentiis (dont on peut goûter au passage l'accent digne de Chico Marx), le ramènera chez lui, de l'autre côté de l'Atlantique… Nourri d'archives et d’extraits de films, choisis avec un sens gourmand du détail et de l'image, ce portrait documentaire couvrant plus de quarante ans de carrière ne prétend pas percer la carapace de Charles Bronson, mais tourne autour de l'attachant mystère qu'elle a protégé, puis fini par entraver.\r\n\r\nCharles Bronson, le génie du mâle\nDocumentaire de Jean Lauritano (France, 2019, 53mn)\r\n\r\n\r\nToute l'actualité du cinéma sur Arte sur :\nhttp://arte.tv/cinema\nhttps://www.facebook.com/artecinema/\n\nSur Facebook : https://www.facebook.com/artetv/\nSur Twitter : https://twitter.com/ARTEfr\nSur Instagram : https://www.instagram.com/artefr/",

        "description": "Tout est parti d’un malaise partagé : en ouvrant les sites X les plus fréquentés au monde, toujours les mêmes images reviennent ; alors qu’aucun sondage sur les fantasmes ne les mentionnent parmi les plus populaires...  Cette vidéo contenant le mot « P*rn* » plus d’une centaine de fois, elle n’est évidemment pas monétisée et c’est pour cela que je remercie très chaleureusement LELO de m’accompagner sur cette enquête. Avec mon code promo CHARLIEBF vous avez -20% de réduction sur tous les jouets LELO et c’est cumulable sur les promos ! Rendez-vous sur : https://lelo.to/CharlieBF2025\n\n(Collaboration commerciale)\n\n\n⚠️𝗜𝗡𝗙𝗢𝗥𝗠𝗔𝗧𝗜𝗢𝗡𝗦 𝗜𝗠𝗣𝗢𝗥𝗧𝗔𝗡𝗧𝗘𝗦 \n_______________________\n\n• Cette vidéo ne traite que des algorithmes de recherche dans la prn0graphie et de la manière dont ils influencent (ou reflètent) certains fant@smes collectifs.\nElle ne porte pas sur une autre problématique tout aussi cruciale : celle des conditions de production, de l’exploitation des travailleur·ses du sxe et des dérives systémiques de cette industrie.\nCe sujet mérite à lui seul une enquête complète, mais il ne relève pas du cadre de cette étude, qui se concentre exclusivement sur les logiques algorithmiques et leurs effets culturels.\nNous avons donc choisi de ne pas ouvrir ce second débat ici, afin de préserver la clarté et la rigueur de l’analyse.\nCela n’enlève rien à l’importance de ces autres enjeux, simplement : ce n’est pas le sujet de cette vidéo. Merci d’en tenir compte pour éviter tout whataboutism dans les échanges.\n\n• Je prononce plusieurs fois le mot \"péd0philie\" dans la vidéo pour désigner la ped* criminalité. Il s'agit d'une erreur de ma part à l'écriture du script pour laquelle je souhaite faire un erratum.\n\n• De même, nous n'avons pas enquêté sur les effets et l'usage de la p*rn0graphie sur les mineurs, qui est aussi un tout autre sujet qui dépasse du cadre du travail réalisé dans cette vidéo. \n\n• Dans la vidéo, nous énonçons le fait que l’addiction au porno n’existe pas. Le terme addiction utilisé dans le langage courant est beaucoup plus large et la définition médicale de l’addiction (encore en débat) est amenée à évoluer en même temps que les recherches sur le sujet avancent. Nous aurions dû ́nuancer cette affirmation en precisant bien qu'il s’agissait du consensus actuel, voué à potentiellement évoluer. Comme certains d'entre vous l’ont judicieusement signalé : c’est donc un débat qui est loin de la réalité du terrain et il est évident aujourd’hui que nous avons donc été trop fermes et maladroits lorsque nous avons exposé ce débat scientifique. Notre but n’a jamais été de minimiser le vécu des personnes atteintes de troubles addictifs liés au sexe ou à la consommation de porno. Et si nos propos ont pu être blessants d’une manière ou d’une autre, nous en sommes sincèrement désolés. Si vous pensez souffrir d'un problème lié à votre consommation, n'hésitez pas à contacter des numéros et des groupes d'aide dédiés ou à prendre rendez-vous avec votre médecin.\n\n🔗 𝗢𝗡 𝗦𝗘 𝗥𝗘𝗧𝗥𝗢𝗨𝗩𝗘 𝗜𝗖𝗜\n_______________________\n\n- Instagram :  https://www.instagram.com/charlie__danger/\n- Twitch :   https://www.twitch.tv/charlie__danger\n- TikTok :   https://www.tiktok.com/@revuesdumonde/\n\nPour toutes démarches professionnelles ou commerciales : lesrevuesdumonde@gmail.com\n\n💖 𝗣𝗢𝗨𝗥 𝗠𝗘 𝗦𝗢𝗨𝗧𝗘𝗡𝗜𝗥\n________________________\n\nCHAQUE don (même quelques euros) soutient la chaîne : https://fr.tipeee.com/les-revues-du-monde\n\n📌 𝗖𝗛𝗔𝗣𝗜𝗧𝗥𝗘𝗦\n_______________________\n\n00:00:00 - Introduction\n00:02:16 - Sur quoi fantasment les gens ?\n00:05:09 - Ce que disent les stats actuelles\n00:11:20 - Étape 1, acquérir les données\n00:18:40 - Étape 2, exploiter les données\n00:27:36 - Étape 3, analyser les données\n00:31:37 - Du coup ça dit quoi de nos fant@smes ?\n00:42:33 - Notre DEUXIÈME étude\n00:50:23 - Limite de la méthodologie\n00:59:05 - Quel est l’effet du p0rno (pour de vrai) ?\n01:04:20 - L’addiction au p0rno existe-t-elle ?\n01:08:00 - Mais du coup, le p0rno est il problématique ?\n01:15:27 - Discussion \n01:21:39 - Promo à regarder pour soutenir la chaine hihi\n\n\n🎥 𝗖𝗥𝗘́𝗗𝗜𝗧𝗦\n_______________________\n\nRecherche et écriture : Charlotte Herpin, Mohamed Ouaguenouni, Hélène Pollet, Charlie Danger  \nMonteurs : Gauthier Spiser, Louis Descombes, Adrien O.

On a corrigé au montage mais je le remet ici, il s'agit bien de LOUIS SEIZE PTDR. J'étais fatiguée et j'ai lu un peu vite sur mon texte, qui plus est je suis pas le couteau le plus aiguisé du tiroir, le ravioli le plus décongelé de la boîte, le crayon le plus taillé de la trousse. Venez vous battre en DM sur Insta si vous êtes pas contents. \n\nDeuxième erratum un peu plus important soulevé par  @manonbrilcuah : Quand je dis que \"L'histoire a techniquement commencé à exister avec Hérodote et Thucydide\" blabla, Manon trouve que c'est confusant parce qu'on dirait que j'explique qu'avant on imaginait pas du tout la notion de passé. On l'évoque plus tard avec la notion de mythes fondateurs et de Damnatio Memoriae mais c'est bon de le redire : Il y avait déjà des \"pensées du passé\" même si elles n'étaient pas formulées sous la forme d'Histoire telle qu'on la connait nous. Même chose pour quand je dis qu'on ne s'est pas toujours intéressé à ce qu'il y avait avant du coup, ce que je veux dire c'est qu'on ne s'y est pas intéressé sous la forme de récit/discipline/enquête comme imaginé par Hérodote. Voilà ! Hésitez pas si vous voulez poursuivre la discussion en commentaires, en vrai c'est hyper intéressant et je suis désolée si ce point n'était pas assez clair.

[ont] invoqué un surpeuplement auquel plus personne ne croit guère, sauf peut-être dans le cas de la Norvège (...)\". Selon lui il faut plutôt mettre l'accent sur la montée en puissance des monarchies scandinaves et \"la quête de l'aventure lointaine qui rapportait (...) la fortune et le prestige militaire qui étaient (...) les clefs de toute réussite\" pour justifier le déplacement des vikings en Occident. \n\nIl dit aussi \"bien plus décisifs dans l'enclanchement de l'expansion viking me paraissent avoir été les contacts maritimes et pacifiques qui ont été noués au tournant du VIIè et VIIIè avec  les mondes scandinaves et baltiques par des Occidentaux\"\n\nPar conséquent, cet aspect est encore débattu dans la communauté scientifique. \n\n➤ Erratum au sujet du terme \"primogéniture\" \n\n Dans cette vidéo, j'utilise le terme \"primogéniture\" pour évoquer en réalité ce qui se décrit comme \" droit du plus ancien \", une erreur sémantique mais qui ne change rien au propos de fond : \n\nPrimogéniture =  fils ainé reste privilégié par rapport à ses frères\nDroit le plus ancien = Le plus ancien dans la ligné (l’oncle avant le fils)\n\nCertaines sources d’historiens se contredisent sur ce point. Sur le principe, les différentes lois favorisaient la primogéniture (où l’aîné était privilégié) tandis que d’autre mettent en avant le droit du plus ancien (c’est à dire le plus âgé de ceux qui se trouvaient en ligne pour l’héritage). Dans un cas comme dans l’autre, les droits de successions favorisent un héritier et délaissent les autres.\n\nSur les sources c’est par exemple Renaud J. dans « les vikings, vérités et legendes » qui va évoqué la primogéniture tandis que dans l’ouvrage « effondrement : comment les sociétés décident de leur disparition ou de leur survie » on va plutôt évoquer le droit du plus ancien. Par rapport aux sources que je vous ai laissé un peu plus haut,  Renaud J. dans « les vikings, vérités et legendes » va évoqué la primogéniture tandis que dans l’ouvrage « effondrement : comment les sociétés décident de leur disparition ou de leur survie » on va plutôt évoquer le droit du plus ancien.\n\n■ Écriture et relecture \n\n• Charlie Danger, Charlotte Herpin\n• Laure Drévillon et Thomas Carpentier\n\n■ Cadrage, production et réalisation\n\nJulie Reynaud, Clara Tessier et Charlie Danger\n\n■ Montage \n\nHéloïse d’Almeida et Jessica Komguen \n\n■ Graphismes \n\nGuillaume Basley pour la DA\nAdem pour la miniature \n\n\nA bientôt pour de nouvelles aventures !\n\n © Les Revues du Monde",

L'exposé complet et systématique de sa théorie se trouve dans le draft des \"Principia Logico-Metaphysica\", mais c'est vraiment pas une lecture facile. Je recommande plutôt son livre \"Abstract Objects\" qui est beaucoup plus pédagogique dans l'exposition. (Il présente d'abord une version de base de sa théorie puis il l'étend progressivement en ajoutant de la modalité puis des types, c'est moins assommant.)\n\nAbstract Objects: https://mally.stanford.edu/abstract-objects.pdf\nPrincipia Logico-Metaphysica: https://mally.stanford.edu/principia.pdf\n\nSpéciale dédicace à \"Evidence Based Bonne Humeur\" qui m'a demandé (pour un futur recueil de ses planches) d'écrire un petit texte de même pas une page sur l'argument ontologique.

        "title": "De quoi ChatGPT est-il VRAIMENT capable ? | Ft. Science4All",
        "description": "Merci à Lê de @le_science4all pour sa relecture et sa contribution ! Un point sur lequel il me suggère d'insister et pour lequel je n'ai pas eu le temps d'ajouter une note de bas de page : on peut imaginer que les prochaines générations de ChatBot ne chercheront plus seulement à prédire ce qu'un humain écrirait, mais de plus en plus à prédire ce que les correcteurs humains préfèrent (parmi les trucs qu'il prédit qu'un humain écrirait). C'est déjà assez nettement le cas avec GPT-3.5 qui est entraîné à éviter certains sujets comme on l'a vu dans la vidéo.\nEt pour en savoir plus sur Tournesol : tournesol.app\n\nMerci aussi à Raphaël Millière dont vous pouvez aller lire l'article ici :\nhttps://nautil.us/welcome-to-the-next-level-of-bullshit-237959/\nOn en avait discuté en visio il y a un moment, et j'ai renoncé à inclure des extraits de notre discussion dans la vidéo car cela aurait beaucoup compliqué le montage (et en plus on ne pouvait pas encore parler de ChatGPT vu que ce n'était pas encore sorti), mais en tout cas je le remercie d'avoir pris ce temps !\n\nMerci aussi à toutes celles et ceux qui m'ont accompagné pendant les lives où je testais Cedille ou ChatGPT (certains des tests que je fais dans cette vidéo m'ont été directement inspiré par le chat de ces lives).\n\nL'article que je mentionne sur GPT-3 jouant aux échecs : https://towardsdatascience.com/gpt-3-play-chess-d123a96096a9\n\nDavid de @ScienceEtonnante me fait remarquer que tous les modèles de langage n'ont pas été entraînés à faire seulement de la prédiction de prochain mot (ou prochain *token* pour être exact, ce qui est un peu moins qu'un mot) ; par exemple certains comme BERT de Google sont aussi entraînés à compléter des \"textes à trou\" (des textes dont 15% des tokens sont cachés). Ceci dit, les modèles GPT sont bien entraînés à la prédiction de prochain token.\n\nEnfin, je me fais à moi-même la remarque suivante : il y aurait sur les modèles de langage bien d'autres choses à dire qui touchent davantage à la philosophie, typiquement sur les questions éthiques, ou sur le rapport au langage et à l'intelligence. Mais le truc c'est que pour ne pas dire n'importe quoi quand on aborde ces sujets, c'est important déjà de bien comprendre de quoi on parle : que sont les modèles de langage et de quoi sont-ils vraiment capables ? Donc c'est surtout sur ce point que j'ai voulu insister dans cette vidéo parce qu'il me semble important de l'éclaircir pour éviter de tomber dans des fantasmes (typiquement des fantasmes sur la conscience des chatbots). Si ça vous intéresse que j'approfondisse le sujet maintenant que je l'ai débroussaillé, j'y reviendrai peut-être dans une autre vidéo ! Dites-moi en commentaire si ça vous dit !\n\nSommaire\n\n0:00 - Intro - Qu'est-ce que ChatGPT ?\n2:49 - À quoi les modèles de langage sont-ils entraînés ?\n6:10 - Test : où l'on voit que ça ne RÉPOND pas, ça PRÉDIT\n10:04 - Mais quand on parle de sujets sensibles...\n11:42 - Lê sur l'\"éducation\" des modèles de langage \n14:25 - Lê présente Tournesol\n16:51 - ChatGPT : transformer un modèle de langage en chatbot\n17:33 - Le problème de Blake Lemoine : un chatbot conscient ?\n21:30 - ChatGPT prétend répondre correctement... \n24:07 - Mais ChatGPT n'est pas du tout fiable.\n27:05 - La machine à bullshit\n30:13 - ChatGPT peut-il surpasser l'intelligence humaine ?\n33:14 - Quand un modèle de langage joue aux échecs...\n36:19 - Outro\n\n\n_____________________________________________\n\n\nLa principale source de financement de la chaîne est le financement participatif.

C'est a dire 45 000 000 m ou 45 000 km et donc ~ 3*14 000 km (rayon terrestre). Il n'y a pas trop de sens à vouloir ici faire un calcul précis car le nombre de générations est indiqué avec une imprécision certainement de l'ordre de 50% et que le point de départ de ce qu'on compte est très flou et très arbitraire (c'est une petite partie de l'arbre du vivant).

Sur la remarque \"il sera impossible de représenter 800 lettres en français en moins de 300 caractères\", le premier point important est que cette remarque est valable en moyenne, il est évident que certains messages utilisant 100 fois le même mots peuvent être communiqués de manière plus compacte, mais c'est un cas particulier, pas le comportement moyen. Dans la modélisation de Shannon on réfléchit en terme de bloc, et d'un bloc au suivant les messages sont supposés indépendants, il y a donc une partie de la structure de la source que le modèle ne capture pas (la logique qu'il pourrait y avoir d'un bloc au suivant et qui permettrait d'économiser de la place durant la transmission). Il suffit pour traiter ce problème de considérer des blocs plus longs et l'entropie à la limite des blocs longs, mais comme ce comportement limite est inatteignable, on peut, dans certains cas de sources, avoir des méthodes de compression au-delà de la limite pratique de Shannon.\n\nPour en savoir plus:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noisy-channel_coding_theorem\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_code\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_entropy\n\nRetrouvez Passe-science sur Utip, Tipeee, Twitter et Facebook:\nhttps://utip.io/passescience\nhttps://www.tipeee.com/passe-science\nhttps://twitter.com/ThomasCabaret84\nhttps://www.facebook.com/passescience.youtube/\n\nMusique:\nhttps://www.musicscreen.org/Royalty-free/Music/sport-tapis.php\nMix Kevin Macleod (Kerbal space program)\nLegend of One by Kevin MacLeod is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 license. https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\nSource: http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1100177\nArtist: http://incompetech.com/\nFlutey Funk by Kevin MacLeod is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 license. https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\nSource: http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1100519\nArtist: http://incompetech.com/\n\nHi-Tech Corporate 2BStudio\n\nBeaucoup issu de YouTube audio library me demander si j'en oublie.",

        "description": "Quel réalisme peut on attribuer à la superposition d'états quantique? doit on en conclure qu'à l'échelle des particules élémentaires plusieurs réalités se superposent? Ou peut on interpréter ce comportement différemment? Regardons ensemble une interprétation à base d'un puissant ingrédient: l'émergence!\n\nRq Importante sur le contenu de cet épisode: la mécanique quantique actuelle est un modèle mathématique dont on constate expérimentalement le succès prédictif. Ce modèle mathématique est particulièrement étrange et donc il est coutume de chercher ce qu'on nomme des interprétations de ce modèle, c'est à dire distinguer parmi les objets et les concepts mathématiques\ndu modèle, lesquels sont des artéfacts de calculs et lesquels correspondent à des objets ou des concepts de notre réalité physique. Il y a de nombreuses interprétations de la mécanique quantique et ici j'aborde, d'une part UNE SEULE de ces interprétations, et d'autre part j'y ajoute des éléments PERSONNELS (comme je le dis un peu tard dans la conclusion mais l'épisode n'était pas prévu aussi long). Dans la vidéo tout ce qui est descriptif du modèle, c'est à dire les représentations en amplitudes, la possibilité d'exprimer les états quantiques dans différentes bases, le comportement de la mesure, le principe d'incertitude d'Heisenberg etc... sont des connaissances consensuelles, il n'y a que dans la partie interprétation, à base d'émergence, que j'ajoute ma touche personnelle. Bon visionnage.\n\nRq importante sur la sphère de Bloch: dans la vidéo je dis que choisir couple d'amplitudes valides (état de spin) est équivalent à choisir un point sur une représentation du nom de sphère de Bloch, rigoureusement c'est équivalent à choisir un point sur cette sphère ET un angle. Il est coutume de ne pas mentionner cet angle car dans la majorité des phénomènes physiques (mais pas dans tous) il ne modifie pas les observations. Le mentionner ici aurait ajouté une complexité inutile dans notre analogie.\n\nPour creuser:\nSur le spin: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRdJMxGNf4s\nSur la notion de fonction d'onde: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7CDdnQ11Hs\nSur l'interprétation des expériences: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTLc0XKei8k\nLes ensembles causaux:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSD5oYWr9-s\n\nRetrouvez Passe-science sur Tipeee, Twitter et Facebook:\r\nhttps://www.tipeee.com/passe-science\r\nhttps://twitter.com/ThomasCabaret84\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/passescience.youtube/\r\n\r\nMusique:\nhttps://www.musicscreen.org/Royalty-free/Music/sport-tapis.php\r\nhttps://www.jamendo.com/track/20236/ambiphonic\r\nKevin Macleod - Groove Grove (Kerbal space program)",

V. Neumann invents the concept of cellular automata, together\nwith a particular 29-state 5-neighbor rule, as a mathematical model in which\nuniversal computation and construction are both possible.\n\n1968: E. F. Codd, develops an 8-state 5-neighbor rule as a simpler alternative to\nVon Neumann's cellular automata. (It took until 2010 for T.Hutton to actually \nbuild the self-replicating machine.)\n\n1969: J. Conway discovers the Game of Life, a 2-state 9-neighbor rule\nwhich he conjectured was capable of universal computation and construction.\n\n1982: Conway, Berlekamp, and Guy finally prove the above ... but the proof\n(described in Winning Ways and The Recursive Universe) would lead to an\nimpractically large and slow machine.\n\n1996: P. Callahan builds the first example of a 'stable reflector': a circuit\ncapable of reflecting gliders asynchronously. All of the circuitry in the 1982\nproof was composed of oscillating components, so could only manipulate\nsynchronized gliders. This reflector was large and slow, and the next\ntwo years saw profound improvements in the technology.\n\n1998: S. Silver found a stable reflector with a recovery time of 497,\nwhich fits within a 64-by-81 box.\n\n2004: D. Greene and P. Chapman build two universal constructors,\none with a static tape and another with a memory loop.\nOnly very simple programs were written for these machines, so they didn't\nself-replicate. They restricted themselves to using only 'Spartan' circuitry made\nof well-separated copies of a few very simple components, to make it easier to\nbuild the circuitry by colliding gliders.\n\nApril 2013: M.Playle discovers the 'Snark', an incredibly small and fast\nstable reflector.\n\nMarch 2015: T. Jacobi discovers a component dubbed the 'Syringe', which\nhas a 90-tick recovery time and can duplicate signals. Suddenly fast efficient\ncircuitry is possible, using Snarks and Syringes. These aren't Spartan, though,\nwhich made people initially reluctant to use them in self-constructing circuitry.\n\nJanuary 2016: Simon Ekstroem showed that a single channel of gliders, with\nadjacent gliders separated by at least 90 ticks, can pull/push a block and emit\nperpendicular gliders. This opened up a whole new possibility of 'single-channel'\nuniversal constructors -- but the remaining piece of the puzzle was to show that \nthese complex objects could actually be synthesized.\n\nJanuary 2017: Adam P. Goucher wrote a search program called HoneySearch\nwhich ran uninterrupted for about three days on 72 CPUs, performing a breadth-\nfirst search of 'slow salvo' glider constructions of objects. This used 100 GB of\nmemory and output 13 GB of efficient recipes of over 200 different objects.\nThis was later filtered down to 800 MB of particularly useful recipes. The Syringe\nand Snark were too complicated to occur naturally during this search, though.\n\nMarch 2017: M Grant and C Cain built constructions for the Snark\nand Syringe, using sample soups on Catalogue  (a very large distributed search\nof random soups in cellular automata):\n\nUsing the HoneySearch results together with these bespoke syntheses, it was\npossible to obtain enough data for an automated synthesis compiler, slmake,\nto build practically anything made of Snarks, Syringes, and over 200 simpler\nobjects.\n\n2017/2018: Adam P. Goucher continued to improve the slmake code to be\nable to efficiently manage larger and more complicated constructions, up to\nand including the 0E0P metacell (finished in late 2018).\n---\n\nMusics:\nhttps://www.musicscreen.org/Royalty-free/Music/sport-tapis.php\nhttps://www.jamendo.com/track/20236/ambiphonic\nhttps://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/most/kerbalspaceprogram.php\n\"observer\" https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary/music\nDecisions: http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1100756\nSci fi bensound: https://www.bensound.com/royalty-free-music/track/sci-fi",

        "description": "La chaîne est 100% financée par vous ! Soutenez l'existence de ces vidéos sur Tipeee (et recevez la newsletter \"dirtybiology version longue\" : https://fr.tipeee.com/dirtybiology )\n\nLe site web (pas hyper utile mais ok) : https://dirtybiology.fr/\n\nVoici le lien de la vidéo sur les distributeurs automatiques japonais : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UJzVLXmBG4 \n\nEt voici pourquoi elle est remplie de bêtises :\n\nDans ladite vidéo, Johnny Harris explique que si le Japon a autant de distributeurs automatiques, c'est parce que 1- la société vieillit et n'a pas assez de travailleurs non qualifiés, et se repose beaucoup sur les \"machines\" pour faire les basses oeuvres 2- le prix du terrain est exhorbitant et payer le loyer d'un magasin est très cher ! La preuve : \"les gens vivent dans des appartements plus petits que votre 4x4\". Un distributeur automatique ne prend pas de place. 3 - les japonais ont une obsession pour l'automatisation et les robots, la preuve : les taxis ont des portes automatiques ! 4- on a beaucoup de petite monnaie à dépenser au Japon, et les distributeurs permettent de se vider les poches.\n\nBon, ça ne vous étonnera peut-être pas de découvrir que quasiment tout est faux.\n1- La société japonaise est effectivement très vieillissante, mais ça n'empêche pas d'avoir des travailleurs non qualifiés. Les chaînes de commerces de proximité comme Family Mart, 7/11 ou Lawson se reposent sur ce genre de main d'oeuvre, et il y en a tous les 100 mètres dans les grandes villes. D'ailleurs, il faut de la main d'oeuvre non qualifiée pour remplir et entretenir ces distributeurs...\n2- Les gens ne vivent pas dans des appartements plus petits que les 4x4; et je ne pense pas que Johnny Harris soit jamais entré dans un appart Japonais. En dehors de certains quartiers, Tokyo a plus une vibe résidentielle, avec des bâtiments qui ne dépassent pas les 2 étages. La taille moyenne d'un appartement à Tokyo est de 65 mètres carrés (rep a sa Paris). Dans tous les cas, l'argument du coût du terrain s'écroule quand on regarde l'abondance de commerces de proximités.\n3- Les taxis japonais ont juste une éthique de travail très différente des nôtres. Les chauffeurs ont des gants, les intérieurs sont extrêmement propres, et ce serait un faux-pas de laisser le passager ouvrir lui même sa porte. Il y a effectivement une affinité culturelle avec l'automatisation, mais elle ne prend de telles proportions que si elle a du sens économiquement (comme...partout, en fait).\n4- On a en effet beaucoup de petite monnaie dans les poches au Japon, mais on peut payer ces distributeurs avec des cartes / avec du sans contact.\n\nPourquoi alors y a-t-il autant de distributeurs ? Simplement : il y en aurait sans doute autant ailleurs si ils ne se faisaient pas déglinguer en 2 jours. Le vandalisme est très rare au Japon et permet d'avoir un cout/bénéfice avantageux pour les entreprises qui les installent. Les gens marchent beaucoup (et il peut faire très chaud et humide) - donc croisent beaucoup de distributeurs -, ne passent pas leurs nerfs sur ces machines qui sont fiables et bien entretenues, leurs propriétaires s'enrichissent tandis que les clients sont contents d'avoir une boisson à la bonne température instantanément. C'est tout.\n\nBref, cette vidéo est vraiment du très très très mauvais boulot de journalisme. 6 millions de vues nonobstant (non j’ai pas le seum haha.... pas du tout....)\n\n###\nLes sources : https://shorturl.at/ghorN\n\n###\nMusiques : Epidemic Sounds\nI'm All In - White Bones\nThirty-Fourth Window - Heath Cantu\nOh Please - Gerhard Feng\nCasino Funk - Arc De Soleil\nMemories of Paris - Trabant 33\nGood to Be Home - Erik Fernholm\nStreets of Seville - Jose Barrios\nCasino Explorer - Stationary Sign\nSalamanca - Sarah, the Illstrumentalist\n\n###\nAide technique (drone, dérush, montage, réparation de chaudières au fioul et retapage de tiny houses dans le larzac) : Raph",
